Tuning: Standard Tuning (EADGBe)

Gale’s singing lead for a change in this one, i love this song.
Pretty easy so here it goes..

Chords:

   <span>D</span>   <span>Am</span>  <span>G</span>   <span>Bm</span>  Bx 
E|-2---0---3---7---10----
B|-3---1---0---7---10----
G|-2---2---0---7----7----
D|-0---2---0---9---------
A|-0---0---2---9---------
E|-x---x---3---7---------

You can play the G in bare too if you like. If you play the Bx, use the
fingerpositions of a normal Bm in bare (on the 7th) and use your pinky to play
the notes on the 10th fret. You can also skip the whole chord if its too hard.


Intro: (humming part)

<span>D</span> <span>Am</span>  x8


Verse 1:

<span>D</span>         <span>Am</span>
I'm gonna get me a bone today

<span>D</span>         <span>Am</span>
Under the big blue sky

<span>D</span>         <span>Am</span>
Under the tree where my last love laid,

<span>D</span>                    <span>Am</span>
Now where beneath the leaves she lies

<span>D</span>         <span>Am</span>
I'm gonna dig a deep hole,

<span>D</span>         <span>Am</span>
  Crack open this bone,

<span>D</span>         <span>Am</span>
See where all the wonder went,

<span>D</span>         <span>Am</span>
See where now it's all gone



Chorus:

<span>G</span>               Bx      <span>Bm</span>
Look at the light, it's full of stars

Bx            <span>G</span>          Bx        <span>Bm</span>
What's really happening? Something wonderful

Bx          <span>G</span>
It's not as bad as I was told,

Bx      <span>Bm</span>
To lose all that was loved

Bx         <span>G</span>    
It's the demons who drag you down

Bx      <span>Bm</span>                Bx   (<span>Am</span> <span>D</span> x3)
But the angels pull you up...



Verse 2:

<span>D</span>             <span>Am</span>
Don't let the colors bring you down,

<span>D</span>                <span>Am</span>
They'll get much brighter one day

<span>D</span>            <span>Am</span>
You know all things must come around 

<span>D</span>      <span>Am</span>
if you leave them in their sway

<span>D</span>         <span>Am</span>
I'm gonna save it all in these photographs

  <span>D</span>      <span>Am</span>
Keep something here for me

<span>D</span>         <span>Am</span>
When I'm dead and gone I'll have the last laugh

 <span>D</span>           <span>Am</span>
At what's left here to see


CHORUS


Instrumental: <span>D</span>, <span>Am</span>


CHORUS


Instrumental: <span>D</span>, <span>Am</span>
