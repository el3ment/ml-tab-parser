%%%% Tab:<i></i>Jet Trail - Turin Brakes
Tabbed by Carol McSweeney

This one comes from TB’s recent Red Moon EP…  Nice and simple but a bit reminiscent of
radiohead's 'fake plastic trees'...



<span>A</span>              <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
Jet Trail, its alright

<span>D</span>                                                                    
Flying thru the blue sky over

                                          <span>A</span>   <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
the heads of the greedy people passing me by

<span>A</span>   <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>


  <span>A</span>       <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
A human cannonball

<span>D</span>
Trying to get presence 
                                                                 <span>A</span>    <span>Dmaj</span>/<span>F#</span>
on a crowded street there’s a girl on the plane she’s looking down

<span>A</span>    <span>D</span>


<span>C</span>           <span>D</span>
She could haunt me

<span>C</span>            <span>D</span>
If she could meet me

<span>C</span>                <span>D</span>
I’m caught up completely, honey
                       <span>A</span>      <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
Cos sadness ain’t my scene


<span>A</span>    <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>


<span>A</span>          <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
5 miles too high

           <span>D</span>                                                               <span>A</span>
I could be landed at heathrow and catching a train back home where I don’t know

<span>A</span>          <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
5 miles too far

<span>D</span>                                                                      
running out of fuel on a pavement quickly 
                           <span>A</span>   <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
I need some sugar in my blood

<span>A</span>   <span>D</span>

<span>C</span>              <span>D</span>
Well, London is hummin’

    <span>C</span>           <span>D</span>
I’m drowning in concrete

    <span>C</span>             <span>D</span>
The buildings are movin’, honey

              <span>A</span>    <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
Sadness is so sweet




         <span>E</span>             <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
Well its all so fuckin’ grey

       <span>E</span>              <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
In the choices that I take

       <span>E</span>               <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
In the memories that I fake

                   <span>A</span>  <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>   <span>A</span>  <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>   <span>A</span>  <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
If anyone wants to know


         <span>D</span>   <span>E</span>                  <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
Just how far anyone should ever go


<span>A</span>  <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>   <span>A</span>  <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
