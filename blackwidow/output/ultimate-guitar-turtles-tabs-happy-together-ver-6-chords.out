<span>Em</span>                                          <span>D</span>
Imagine me and you, I do, I think about you day and night, it's only right,
                   <span>C</span>                                             <span>B7</span>
To think about the girl you love, and hold her tight, so happy together.

If I should call you up, invest a dime, and you say you belong to me, and ease my mind,
                <span>C</span>                                        <span>B7</span>
Imagine how the world could be, so very fine, so happy together.

When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue, for all my life.


<span>Em</span>                                            <span>D</span>
Me and you and you and me, no matter how they toss the dice, it has to be.
                 <span>C</span>                                     <span>B7</span>
