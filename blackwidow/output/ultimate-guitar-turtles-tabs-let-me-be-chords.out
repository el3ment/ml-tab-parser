                              "Let Me Be"
                              (P.F. Sloan)

Intro:

	<span>D</span>   <span>A</span>    <span>D6</span>  <span>E</span>		[2X; 12-string enters 2nd time]
	/ / / /  / / / /

Verse 1:

	  <span>D</span>              <span>E</span>      <span>D</span>          <span>E</span>
	Please don't mistake me or try to make me
	      <span>D</span>        <span>E</span>       <span>A</span>
	The shadow of anybody else
	<span>D</span>            <span>E</span>      <span>D</span>              <span>E</span>
	I ain't the him or her you think I am
	          <span>D</span>      <span>E</span>            <span>A</span>
	I'm just trying hard to be myself
	          <span>E</span>                     <span>A</span>
	Though society's goal is to be part of the whole
	           <span>D</span>                       <span>E</span>
	That may sound good to you, not to me

Chorus:

	       <span>A</span>
	Let me be, let me be
	    <span>D</span>            <span>E</span>
	To think like I want to
	       <span>A</span>
	Let me be, let me be
	        <span>D</span>        <span>E</span>
	That's all I ask of you
	  D                       C#m   Bm     [1,2: repeat intro  3: to coda]
	I am what I am and that's all I ever can be

Verse 2:

	Don't try to plan me or understand me
	I can't stand to be understood
	I could never give in to or ever live up to
	Being like you think I should
	I've got some inner need that I'm tryin' to heed
	I can't take hand-me-down destiny

[repeat chorus]

Verse 3:

	Don't try to change me or rearrange me
	To satisfy the selfishness in you
	I'm not a piece of clay to mold to your moves each day
	And I'm not a pawn to be told how to move
	I'm sorry I ain't the fool you thought would play by your rules
	A to-each-is-own philosophy

[repeat chorus]

Coda:

	    <span>A</span>
	(...be)

	               <span>D</span>     <span>E</span>       <span>A</span>
	I said that's all I ever can be   [repeat to fade]
