%%%% Tab:<i></i>Verse 1:
<span>G</span>                                          <span>C</span>
Way back before she hit the scene
                              <span>G</span>
And she became the envy queen
                                 <span>C</span>
She was a girl with nothing big to say
<span>G</span>                                          <span>C</span>
Her mouth was full of silver spoons
                              <span>G</span>
Singing her dime-a-dozen tunes
                                                   <span>C</span>
‘Til she came up with something new to play

Prechorus:
<span>G</span>                          <span>C</span>            <span>D</span>
A girl so scared, a pain so real
<span>G</span>                          <span>C</span>                          <span>D</span>
A life so hard, becomes a song you feel
<span>G</span>
Her tracks were leaked and all the hipsters freaked
<span>G</span>                            <span>C</span>
She made herself a star

Chorus:
<span>G</span>                                         <span>Am</span>
She wants, she wants, she wants to be original
<span>G</span>                     <span>Am</span>                <span>C</span>
She will, she will, become something remarkable
<span>G</span>                                          <span>Am</span>
Who cares, who cares, who cares what stunt she has to pull
<span>C</span>           <span>G</span>          <span>D</span>                <span>G</span>
She’ll be remade as somebody original

Verse 2:
<span>G</span>                          <span>C</span>
Way back before the interviews
                                <span>G</span>
Before her music made the news
                                <span>C</span>
She was nothing no one talked about
<span>G</span>                           <span>C</span>
A mousy girl behind the mic
                        <span>G</span>
One more vanilla look-alike
                        <span>C</span>
‘Til she decided to stand out

Prechorus:
<span>G</span>                                 <span>C</span>          <span>D</span>
And now it’s crazy clothes, a brand new name
<span>G</span>                       <span>C</span>      <span>D</span>
A fixed up nose, and monster fame
<span>G</span>
Though she might say that she was born this way
<span>G</span>                      <span>C</span>
She made herself a star

Chorus:
<span>G</span>                                         <span>Am</span>
She wants, she wants, she wants to be original
<span>G</span>                     <span>Am</span>               <span>C</span>
She will, she will become something remarkable
<span>G</span>                                            <span>Am</span>
Who cares, who cares, who cares what stunt she has to pull
<span>C</span>             <span>G</span>                  <span>D</span>        <span>G</span>
She’ll be remade as somebody original

Bridge:
<span>A</span>                          <span>G</span>
You can wipe away everything you are
<span>A</span>                                  <span>G</span>
Wake up tomorrow as a star

Verse 3:
<span>G</span>                       <span>C</span>
There was a girl who blended in
                                <span>G</span>
That was the way her life had been
                                   <span>C</span>
‘Til she decided to be someone else

Chorus:
<span>G</span>                                         <span>Am</span>
She wants, she wants, she wants to be original
<span>G</span>                     <span>Am</span>               <span>C</span>
She will, she will become something remarkable
<span>G</span>                                           <span>Am</span>
Who cares, who cares, who cares what stunt she has to pull
<span>C</span>          <span>G</span>               <span>D</span>            <span>G</span>
She’ll be remade as somebody original

<span>G</span>              <span>C</span>
Somebody original
<span>G</span>             <span>C</span>      <span>Am</span>
Somebody original
<span>G</span>              <span>C</span>
Somebody original
