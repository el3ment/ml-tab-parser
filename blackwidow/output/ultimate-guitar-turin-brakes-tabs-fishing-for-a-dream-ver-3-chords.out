This is Ollies rhythm part, the way he plays it.  Ollie has his own unique
way of playing certain chords, hence playing regular open chords and barre chords do not always 
sound right compared to their records or live performances.

<span>Cmaj</span>*           87X080          (<span>C</span> shaped like <span>A</span> <span>G</span> on the 8th fret)

<span>C/B</span>             x20010   		

(The C/B is used as a fill when running up to the Cmaj from the Am and is actually
played by Gale but sounds good if you are playing on your own)

When you have mastered the intro thats most of the song down as the intro, verse 
and outro uses the same chord progression.
