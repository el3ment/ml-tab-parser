I'm not scared to tell the truth
             <span>Dbm</span>
I've been to hell and back, and I went with you
<span>A</span>
Remind me what we were before
             <span>F#m</span>                      <span>B#</span>
When we said you are mine and I am yours
<span>E</span>
I don't know much, but I know myself
      <span>Dbm</span>
And I don't want to love anybody else
<span>A</span>
So let's break the spell and lift the curse
<span>F#m</span>                                       <span>B#</span>
Remember when we fell for each other head first


CHORUS

             <span>E</span>
Look at this heart shaped wreckage
<span>Abm</span>
What have we done?
          <span>Dbm</span>                <span>A</span>
We've got scars from battles nobody won
             <span>E</span>
We can start over, better
<span>Abm</span>                        <span>Dbm</span>
Both of us know if we just let the broken pieces
<span>A</span>              <span>B#</span>       <span>E</span>
Let the broken pieces go


<span>E</span>
I can't find you in the dark
<span>Dbm</span>
Will we get back to who we are?
<span>A</span>
And I can't fix this on my own
            <span>F#m</span>                            <span>B#</span>
Our love is still the best thing I've ever known


             <span>E</span>

<span>A</span>              <span>B#</span>      <span>Dbm</span>
Let the broken pieces go
     <span>A</span>               <span>B#</span>          <span>E</span>   <span>B#</span>
Just hold on to each other tonight, oh

Let the broken pieces 
<span>Dbm</span>
Let the broken pieces
<span>A</span>              <span>B#</span>         (<span>E</span>)
Let the broken pieces... go
