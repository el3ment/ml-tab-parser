My mother bought it secondhand
        <span>Bdim</span>/<span>A</span>       <span>A</span>
From a silent movie star
       <span>Asus2</span>/<span>C#</span>                            <span>Dsus2</span>   <span>D</span>
It was out of tune but still I learned to play
    <span>F#m</span>              <span>D</span>                
And with each note we both would smile
 <span>F#m</span>              <span>C#m</span>
Forgetting who we are
     <span>Dm</span>                <span>E</span>       <span>Asus4</span>
And all the pain would simply fly away


          <span>D</span>              <span>A</span>     
Something secondhand and broken
           <span>D</span>             <span>A</span>
Still can make a pretty sound
      <span>D/F#</span>          <span>A/E</span>      <span>B/D#</span>     <span>C#</span>/<span>F</span>
Even if it doesn't have a place to live
        <span>F#m</span>                 <span>A/E</span> 
Oh, the words were left unspoken
         <span>F#m</span>/<span>D#</span>       <span>Dm</span>
When my Mama came around
         <span>A/C#</span>              <span>Dm</span>       
But that Secondhand White Baby Grand
  <span>F#m</span>               <span>E</span>         <span>Asus2</span>   <span>A</span>
Still had something beautiful to give


<span>Bbsus2</span>                                 
Through missing keys and broken strings
 <span>Cdim</span>/<span>Bb</span>          <span>Bb</span>
The music was our own
<span>Bbsus2</span>/<span>D</span>            <span>Ebsus2</span>         <span>Eb</span>
Until the day we said our last goodbyes
    <span>Gm</span>             <span>Eb</span>  
The baby grand was sent away
   <span>Gm</span>       <span>Dm</span>
A child all alone
    <span>Ebm</span>          <span>F</span>          <span>Bb</span>
To pray somebody else would realize


                <span>Eb</span>           <span>Bb</span>
That something secondhand and broken
          <span>Eb</span>             <span>Bb</span>
Still can make a pretty sound
     <span>Eb/G</span>          <span>Bb/F</span>            <span>C/E</span>     <span>D/F#</span>
Even if it doesn't have a place to live
        <span>Gm</span>              <span>Bb/F</span>
Oh, the words are still unspoken
         <span>Gm</span>/<span>E</span>        <span>Ebm</span>
Now that Mama's not around
          <span>Bb/D</span>             <span>Ebm</span>
But that Secondhand White Baby Grand
<span>Gm</span>                  <span>F</span>            <span>Bbsus2</span>   <span>Bb</span>
Still has something beautiful to give


<span>Gb</span>/<span>Bb</span>                           <span>Bb</span>
For many years the music had to roam
<span>Dm</span>                              <span>E</span>
Until we found a way to find a home


<span>Asus2</span>      
So now I wake up every day
    <span>Bdim</span>/<span>A</span>           <span>A</span>
And see her standing there
     <span>Asus2</span>/<span>C#</span>                 <span>Dsus2</span>    <span>D</span>
Just waiting for a partner to compose
      <span>F#m</span>            <span>D</span>
And I wish my mother still could hear
     <span>F#m</span>             <span>C#m</span>
That sound beyond compare
     <span>Dm</span>              <span>E</span>           <span>Asus4</span>   <span>A</span>
I'll play her song till everybody knows


                <span>D</span>              <span>A</span>
That something secondhand and broken
          <span>D</span>              <span>A</span>
Still can make a pretty sound
         <span>D/F#</span>          <span>A/E</span>      <span>B/D#</span>     <span>C#</span>/<span>F</span>
Don't we all deserve a family room to live
        <span>F#m</span>              <span>A/E</span>
Oh, the words can't stay unspoken
       <span>F#m</span>/<span>D#</span>       <span>Dm</span>
Until everyone has found

      <span>A/C#</span>             <span>Dm</span>
That Secondhand White Baby Grand
     <span>F#m</span>                 <span>Dm</span>      <span>E</span>    <span>Asus2</span>   <span>A</span>
That still has something beautiful to give
    <span>Dm</span>/<span>F</span>               <span>E</span>           <span>A</span>
I still have something beautiful to give
