%%%% Tab:<i></i>I looked at the other tabs for Cigarette, and they were just a bit off, 
so I decided to post my own.  First time ever!  But I love figuring
songs out and playing them, so hey, spreading the love.  Enjoy!


[Capo up to 4th fret]
                     
                                Cigarette
(INTRO)

| <span>C</span> | <span>G</span> | <span>A</span> | <span>B</span> |

(VERSE 1)

<span>Em</span>             <span>B</span>          <span>D</span>           <span>A</span>     
Smoked my last cigarette, sat in bed for a while,
<span>C</span>               <span>G</span>             <span>A</span>            <span>B</span>
Thought of your face and that brought me a smile,
<span>Em</span>      <span>B</span>           <span>D</span>          <span>A</span>
Wanted another one, fell back asleep instead,
<span>C</span>              <span>G</span>           <span>A</span>            <span>B</span>
Woke and found you sitting there on the bed

(CHORUS)

<span>D</span>          <span>A</span>          <span>E</span>          <span>B</span>
Cigarette, cigarette, burning up time.
<span>D</span>          <span>A</span>          <span>E</span>         <span>B</span>
Cigarette, cigarette, watch the smoke climb.
<span>D</span>          <span>A</span>          <span>E</span>        <span>B</span>
Cigarette, cigarette, wasting away...
<span>D</span>              <span>A</span>          <span>E</span>           <span>B</span>
Just like this cigarette, our time is running down,
<span>D</span>        <span>A</span>                <span>B</span>            <span>C#</span>
only one hour 'til you're leavin' this town.

(VERSE 2)

Walked to the corner store, bought us another pack,
Held my arm 'round you as we headed back.
I tried to change your mind, didn't want you to go,
I love you more, I think, than you will ever know.

(CHORUS)

(BRIDGE)

<span>D</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>E</span>   <span>B</span>
Ah, ah, ah, ah,
<span>D</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>E</span>       <span>B</span>
Ah, ah, a-a-ah, a-ah,
<span>D</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>E</span>   <span>B</span>
Ah, ah, ah, ah,

<span>D</span>              <span>A</span>          <span>E</span>           <span>B</span>
Just like this cigarette, our time is running down,
<span>D</span>        <span>A</span>                <span>B</span>            <span>C#</span>
only one hour 'til you're leavin' this town.

<span>Em</span>              <span>B</span>          <span>D</span>           <span>A</span>   
Smoked one last cigarette, sat in bed for a while,
<span>C</span>               <span>G</span>             <span>A</span>            <span>B</span>
Thought of your face and that brought me a smile.
