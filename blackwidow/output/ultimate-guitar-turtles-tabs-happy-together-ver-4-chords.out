        <span>Em</span>           
Imagine me and you, I do; 
                  <span>D</span>
I think about you day and night, 

It's only right 
                   <span>C</span>       
To think about the girl you love, 

and hold her tight; 
           <span>B7</span>
so happy together 

            <span>Em</span>
If I should call you up,

invest a dime 
                  <span>D</span>
And you say you belong to me, 

and ease my mind 
                <span>C</span>
Imagine how the world could be, 

so very fine; 
           <span>B7</span>
so happy together 

<span>E</span>              <span>Bm</span>                <span>E</span>
I can't see me loving nobody but you, 
           <span>G</span>
for all my life 
<span>E</span>         
When you're with me,
<span>Bm</span>                     <span>E</span>
baby the skies will be blue; 
           <span>G</span>
for all my life 

<span>Em</span>
Me and you, 

and you and me; 
                   <span>D</span>
no matter how they tossed the dice, 

it had to be 
                 <span>C</span>
The only one for me is you, 

and you for me; 
           <span>B7</span>
so happy together 

<span>E</span>              <span>Bm</span>                <span>E</span>
I can't see me loving nobody but you,
           <span>G</span>
for all my life 
<span>E</span>         
When you're with me,
<span>Bm</span>                     <span>E</span>
baby the skies will be blue, 
           <span>G</span>
for all my life 

<span>Em</span>
Me and you, 

and you and me;
                   <span>D</span>
no matter how they tossed the dice, 

it had to be 
                 <span>C</span>
The only one for me is you,

and you for me; 
           <span>B7</span>    <span>Em</span>
so happy together 
           <span>B7</span>    <span>Em</span>
So happy together 
           <span>B7</span>    <span>Em</span>
So happy together 
           <span>B7</span>     <span>Em</span>
How is the weather? 
           <span>B7</span>    <span>Em</span>
So happy together 
           <span>B7</span>    <span>Em</span>
So happy together 
           <span>B7</span>    <span>E</span>
So happy together
