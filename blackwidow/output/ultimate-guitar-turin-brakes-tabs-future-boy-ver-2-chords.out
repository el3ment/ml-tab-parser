So future boy where are you from, My time machine crashed over yonder.
<span>D7</span>                              <span>G</span>
Syphillis is a bitch but contracting hiv is much worse.
<span>D</span>                        <span>Dmaj7</span>                    <span>D7</span>                   <span>G</span>
Why are you pushing info into me, I have no need for it, I'm from the stars.

   <span>D</span>                                      <span>Dmaj7</span>                              
I thought you'd like to know your scoop, I'm taking babies back with me,yeah.
<span>D7</span>                           <span>G</span>
I'm taking them back home so they can see there's a much better place.
   <span>D</span>                      <span>Dmaj7</span>                 <span>D7</span>                         <span>G</span>
I've got a sister with an open mind and my friends are all junkies but there still my friends,

   <span>D</span>                      <span>Dmaj7</span>                  <span>D7</span>                         <span>G</span>
As long as they don't use monkeys, We enjoy the heat of stolen days in the summer of 93.

               <span>D</span>                                  <span>Dmaj7</span>
Well the future boy said I've got friends but you know sometimes
                      <span>D7</span>                            <span>G</span>
It all depends on how tall they are against yourself.
<span>D</span>                    <span>Dmaj7</span>                 <span>D7</span>                   <span>G</span>
