%%%% Tab:<i></i>this is the main bit without the complicated tabby bits havent worked them out yet.
the strumming paterns pretty basic and theres only 4 chords:
<span>Bm</span>: x24432
<span>D</span>: xx0232
<span>G</span>: 320033
<span>F#m</span>: 244222

<span>Bm</span>          <span>D</span>     
  life isnt always easy
<span>G</span>         <span>F#m</span> 
  this we know my friends
<span>Bm</span>              <span>D</span>
  i thought you knew where to go
<span>G</span>                        <span>F#m</span>          
  but you were following me
              <span>Bm</span> 
  so lets get lost in space
    <span>D</span>
  i feel displaced
<span>G</span>               <span>F#m</span>
  im stuck in a rat race
        <span>Bm</span>            <span>D</span>
  its a lovely day to lose your way
<span>G</span>                    <span>F#m</span>
  and get stuck in a lo-o-o-o-p

Chorus:

ocer and over again       }
                          }x4 with the same chords and pattern
you can never make it stop}


the other verses and choruses are pretty much the same. if any one can see any probs
please let me know. enjoy  SQ05
