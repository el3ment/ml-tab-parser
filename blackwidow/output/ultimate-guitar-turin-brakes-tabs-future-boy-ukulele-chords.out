Syphillis is a bitch but contracting hiv is much worse.

Why are you pushing info into me, I have no need for it, I'm from the stars.

As long as they don't use monkeys, We enjoy the heat of stolen days in the summer of 93.

               <span>C</span>                                  <span>Cmaj7</span>
