%%%% Tab:<i></i>Intro chords: <span>G</span>  <span>C</span>  <span>Bm</span>  <span>D</span>     

<span>G</span>                      <span>C</span>                     <span>Bm</span>                   <span>D</span>   
Cubscouts are screaming needing icecreaming & all the pleasures of June
<span>G</span>                   <span>C</span>                       <span>Bm</span>                      <span>D</span>   
I'm in a parked car. Flowers seem friendly & people in hallways fill walls
<span>G</span>                    <span>C</span>                       <span>Bm</span>              <span>D</span>   
Now it is night time, maybe we're cruising avoiding the anti-cruise
<span>G</span>                       <span>C</span>         <span>Bm</span>     
Oh, I don't really know where we are

<span>D</span>             <span>Am</span>             <span>C</span>                 <span>Bm</span>   <span>D</span>   
If things get real promise to take me somewhere else____
       <span>Am</span>                 <span>C</span>                     <span>Bm</span>   <span>D</span>
By the time fear takes me over will we still be roll___ing
                       <span>G</span>
...and feeling oblivion


<span>G</span>  <span>C</span>  <span>Bm</span>  <span>D</span> x 2


<span>G</span>                  <span>C</span>                     <span>Bm</span>                            <span>D</span>   
Once in a while now the lie in the laughter can burn through a hole in my ears
       <span>G</span>                 <span>C</span>                     <span>Bm</span>                    <span>D</span>   
Like a man with glasses catching a sunbeam and burning the skin of a kid
<span>G</span>                    <span>C</span>                     <span>Bm</span>       <span>D</span>   
Hypereal fragments disturbing the stagnants of almighty fear
     <span>G</span>                     <span>C</span>     <span>Bm</span>     
Well I'll just go under the wa___ter

<span>D</span>             <span>Am</span>             <span>C</span>                 <span>Bm</span>   <span>D</span>   
If things get real promise to take me somewhere else____
       <span>Am</span>                 <span>C</span>                     <span>Bm</span>   <span>D</span>
By the time fear takes me over will we still be roll___ing
                       <span>G</span>
...and feeling oblivion


<span>G</span>  <span>C</span>  <span>Bm</span>  <span>D</span> x 2


   <span>G</span>     <span>C</span>     <span>Bm</span>   <span>D</span>    
So don't leave me
<span>G</span>    <span>C</span>      <span>Bm</span>   <span>D</span>    
Here on my own
   <span>G</span>     <span>C</span>     <span>Bm</span>   <span>D</span>    
So don't leave me
<span>G</span>    <span>C</span>      <span>Bm</span>   <span>D</span>    
Here on my own

<span>D</span>             <span>Am</span>             <span>C</span>                 <span>Bm</span>   <span>D</span>

By the time fear takes me over will we still be roll___ing
                       <span>G</span>
...and feeling oblivion
