%%%% Tab:<i></i>Intro: <span>C#m</span>  <span>C</span>  <span>G</span>  <span>F#</span>


<span>C#m</span>      <span>C</span>                 <span>G</span>                      <span>F#</span>
Mind over money  Bent over backwards  Light up my life like a

(still F#)                 (back to C#m, repeats process)
very last cigarette, and time after time dear......

(follows this pattern)

<span>A</span>   <span>F#m</span>      <span>E</span>          <span>G</span>     <span>A</span>         <span>F#m</span>
That's alright,  i warned myself,    there's blood on the inside,

       <span>E</span>      <span>G</span>    <span>A</span>         <span>F#m</span>            <span>E</span>       <span>G</span>
but nowhere else,    up on a shelf, that's where i need

<span>A</span>        <span>F#m</span>       <span>E</span>
to be,  la da da dee


Repeat this pattern for the rest of the song
