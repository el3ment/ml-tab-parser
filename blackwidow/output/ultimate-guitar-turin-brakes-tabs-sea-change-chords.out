Verse 1:
<span>Em</span>
Six billion backs against the wall
                  <span>Am</span>
Now do we walk or run
<span>Em</span>
This puzzles falling into place
                     <span>Am</span>
Once more around the sun

Bridge:
<span>A</span>
Remember when we where a kids 
                       <span>Am</span>
Those days were all so long

Chorus:
<span>G</span>            <span>D</span>   <span>C</span>
But if don't do this      x2
<span>A</span>             <span>C</span>             
Somebody else will

Verse 2:
Three billion backs againts the wall 
A prayer for everyone
We saw the changing of the sea 
But not a thing was done

Bridge:
Remember when you could rely 
Those days are all but gone

Chorus
And if don't do this     x2
Somebody else will

Verse 3:
One billion backs againts the wall
At leaat I feel we're dry
I was an island to myself
This storm would pass me but

Bridge:
Remember all the things we did
I knew i would survive

Chorus:
And if don't do this   x2
Somebody else will

Verse 4:
One million backs against the wall
Now do we walk or run
One thousand backs agiants the wall 
Now do we walk or run
One hundred backs against the wall 
Now do we walk or run
Its just your back against the wall
Now do you walk or run

Bridge:
Remember when we were a kid
Those days are all but gone

Chorus:
And if don't do this    x2
Nobody else will
