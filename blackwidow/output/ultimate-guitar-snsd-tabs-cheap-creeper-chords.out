Intro: <span>Am</span> . . . <span>C</span> <span>Dm</span> (2x)
       


-->VERSE<--
                   <span>Am</span>
[Tiffany] You only wear cologne that comes in the sample size
                                                <span>C</span>         <span>Dm</span>     <span>Am</span>
Your watch says Rolex, but I know you bought it from some guy on Fifth Street

Who also sells fake ids, can't trick me
                   <span>C</span>        <span>Dm</span>
I've seen it all before you see
                       <span>Am</span>
[Seohyun] You drive an Audi that you rented from Alamo
                                                 <span>C</span>        <span>Dm</span>       <span>Am</span>
You got the hook-up from your cousin who's the regional manager on weekdays

She gave it to you for one night for free
                            <span>C</span>       <span>Dm</span>
Don't you wish you drove it in real life?


-->PRE-CHORUS<--

[Taeyeon] You're frontin' like you're Trump-kind of money
                          <span>F</span>                 <span>C</span>                <span>E</span>
When you're really just a 26 year old chump living with your Mommy

                              <span>C</span>            <span>Dm</span>

Sneaky eyes, that don't know how to lie
                                    <span>C</span>            <span>Dm</span>
But the truth I see, is that you're just a Cheap Creeper
        <span>Am</span>

                                     <span>C</span>     <span>Dm</span>
Behind your dark sunglasses watching every move
    <span>Am</span>
I'm making, can almost feel your hands on me
                                        <span>C</span>     <span>Dm</span>
