Hey folks, i felt like the other versions of this song didnt sound quite right.
So I tried by myself to figure out a better version.

Sounds best if you play the Chords in barre!

Have fun, frisco`

Verse 1:

	        <span>Bm</span>
	Imagine me and you, I do
	                   <span>A</span>
	I think about you day and night, it's only right
	                    <span>G</span>
	To think about the girl you love  and hold her tight
	           <span>F#</span>
	So happy together

Verse 2:

	If I should call you up, invest a dime
	And you say you belong to me  and ease my mind
	Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
	So happy together

Chorus:

	<span>D</span>              <span>C</span>                 <span>D</span>
	I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
	            <span>F</span>
	For all my life
	<span>D</span>                   <span>C</span>                     <span>D</span>
	When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue
	            <span>F</span>
	For all my life

Verse 3:

	Me and you and you and me
	No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be
	The only one for me is you, and you for me
	So happy together
