My absolute favorite Turtles single - in fact, one of my favorite singles,

Verse 1:

	 <span>E</span> [12-string repeats intro riff on <span>E</span>/<span>A</span>/<span>D</span> strings]
	You can try to please me
	But it won't be easy
	<span>Bm</span>               <span>A</span>
	Stone walls surround me
	         <span>G</span>                    <span>D</span>

Chorus:

	         <span>A</span>                       <span>D</span>

	                             (you don't stand an outside chance)
	    <span>B7</span>                       <span>E</span>
	You don't stand an outside chance

	Whatever you do girl

	I'm only flesh and bone
	         <span>G</span>      <span>D</span>      <span>Em</span>
	But you may as well forget me
