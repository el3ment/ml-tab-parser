Intro: <span>Eb</span> <span>Eb</span>/<span>Db</span> <span>Eb</span>/<span>C</span> <span>B</span>

<span>Eb</span>             <span>Eb</span>/<span>Db</span>
Everyday is so wonderful
         <span>Eb</span>/<span>C</span>                <span>B</span>
And suddenly, it's hard to breathe
<span>Eb</span>                  <span>Eb</span>/<span>Db</span>
Now and then, i get insecure
             <span>Eb</span>/<span>C</span>            <span>B</span>
From all the pain, i'm so ashamed

<span>Ab</span>                <span>Fm</span>
I am beautiful no matter what they say
<span>Eb</span>           <span>Db</span>      <span>Ab</span>
Words can't bring me down
<span>Ab</span>                <span>Fm</span>
I am beautiful in every single way
     <span>Eb</span>           <span>Db</span>      <span>Ab</span>
Yes, words can't bring me down
<span>Fm</span>                           <span>Eb</span>  <span>Eb</span>/<span>Db</span> <span>Eb</span>/<span>C</span> <span>B</span>
So don't you bring me down today

<span>Eb</span>                           <span>Eb</span>/<span>Db</span>
To all your friends, you're delirious
      <span>Eb</span>/<span>C</span>               <span>B</span>
So consumed in all your doom
<span>Eb</span>                      <span>Eb</span>/<span>Db</span>
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
           <span>Eb</span>/<span>C</span>                  <span>B</span>
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
Is that the way it is?

<span>Ab</span>                   <span>Fm</span>
You are beautiful no matter what they say
<span>Eb</span>          <span>Db</span>        <span>Ab</span>
Words can't bring you down
<span>Ab</span>                   <span>Fm</span>
You are beautiful in every single way
     <span>Eb</span>          <span>Db</span>        <span>Ab</span>
Yes, words can't bring you down
<span>Fm</span>                           <span>Eb</span>
So don't you bring me down today

                 <span>Eb</span>/<span>Db</span>
No matter what we do
                  <span>Eb</span>/<span>C</span>
No matter what we say
                           <span>B</span>
We're the song inside the tune
                     <span>Eb</span>
Full of beautiful mistakes

                 <span>Eb</span>/<span>Db</span>
And everywhere we go
                    <span>Eb</span>/<span>C</span>
The sun will always shine
                        <span>B</span>
But tomorrow we might awake
On the other side

<span>Ab</span>                         <span>Fm</span>
'cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
     <span>Eb</span>          <span>Db</span>       <span>Ab</span>
Yes, words won't bring us down
<span>Ab</span>                  <span>Fm</span>
We are beautiful in every single way
     <span>Eb</span>          <span>Db</span>       <span>Ab</span>
Yes, words can't bring us down
<span>Fm</span>                            <span>Eb</span>  <span>Eb</span>/<span>Db</span> <span>Eb</span>/<span>C</span> <span>B</span>
So, don't you bring me down today
                          <span>Eb</span>
Don't you bring me down today
