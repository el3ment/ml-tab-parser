<span>G</span> - <span>F</span> (x4)

<span>G</span>                          <span>F</span>
Batten up the hatches, here comes the cold
<span>G</span>                          <span>F</span>
I can feel it creeping, it's making me old
<span>G</span>                          <span>F</span>                        <span>G</span> - <span>F</span>
You give me so much love that it blows my brains out

<span>G</span>                          <span>F</span>
You need something better than the bacon and eggs
<span>G</span>                          <span>F</span>
The creaking in the walls and the banging in the bed
<span>G</span>                          <span>F</span>                        <span>G</span> - <span>C</span>
You give me so much love that it blows my brains out


<span>D</span>       <span>Bm</span>   <span>Cadd9</span>                        <span>D</span>  
 Summer rain, dripping down your face again
        <span>Bm</span>   <span>Cadd9</span>                        <span>D</span>  
 Summer rain, praying someone feels the same
          <span>Bm</span>           <span>Cadd9</span>                          
 Take the pain killer, cycle on your bicycle
<span>D</span>                 <span>Bm</span>    <span>Cadd9</span>                          
Leave all this misery behind

<span>G</span> - <span>F</span> (x4)

<span>G</span>         <span>F</span>             <span>G</span>                        <span>F</span>
My love giving me head, feeling very guilty, breaking the bread
<span>G</span>                          <span>F</span>            <span>G</span> - <span>F</span>
Losing my attention, taking the world on
<span>G</span>                          <span>F</span>
So batten up the hatches, here comes the cold
<span>G</span>                          <span>F</span>
I can feel it creeping, it's making me old
<span>G</span>                          <span>F</span>                        <span>G</span> - <span>C</span>
You give me so much love that it blows my brains out

<span>D</span>       <span>Bm</span>   <span>Cadd9</span>                        <span>D</span>  
 Summer rain, dripping down your face again
        <span>Bm</span>   <span>Cadd9</span>                        <span>D</span>  
 Summer rain, praying someone feels the same
          <span>Bm</span>           <span>Cadd9</span>                          
 Take the pain killer, cycle on your bicycle
<span>D</span>                 <span>Bm</span>    <span>Cadd9</span>                          
Leave all this misery behind

<span>G</span>      <span>F</span> <span>G</span>      <span>F</span> <span>G</span>      <span>F</span> <span>G</span>      <span>C</span>
My love, my love, my love, my love

<span>D</span>       <span>Bm</span>   <span>Cadd9</span>                        <span>D</span>  
 Summer rain, dripping down your face again
        <span>Bm</span>   <span>Cadd9</span>                        <span>D</span>  
 Summer rain, praying someone feels the same
          <span>Bm</span>           <span>Cadd9</span>                          
 Take the pain killer, cycle on your bicycle
