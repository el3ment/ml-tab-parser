- From the album - The songs of Tony Sly - A Tribute




- Enjoy!





- Intro: <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span>  
         <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span> <span>G</span> <span>F#</span>




- Verse 1:

<span>Bm</span>
I'll see you on the outside
<span>G</span>
And we'll never be the same
<span>E</span>
After all that's happened
<span>F#</span>
What it is that we've gained?

<span>Bm</span>
I've made mistakes before
<span>G</span>
And never lived them down
<span>D</span>               <span>A</span>              <span>F#</span>
After all you've done for me I'm bound



- Chorus:

<span>F#</span>
(Don't say another word)
<span>G</span>                     <span>D</span>    
To see you on the outside 
                            <span>A</span>
Where we can both feel shame
<span>A</span>                          <span>G</span>
(You're speaking for yourself)
                          <span>D</span>
I am bleeding on the inside
                          <span>A</span>
A place you might have been
               <span>G</span>         <span>D</span>        <span>F#</span>
But now I know I'll never be the same




- Post-Chorus: <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span>  
               <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span> <span>G</span> <span>F#</span>




- Verse 2:

<span>Bm</span>
I heard you got a new place
<span>G</span>
And it's far away from here
<span>E</span>
Reality has sunken in now
<span>F#</span>
Confirming all my fears 

<span>Bm</span>
I am not gonna drag you down
<span>G</span>
But it's too late to stop
<span>D</span>                    <span>A</span>              <span>F#</span>
Thinking about the time that we have lost





- Chorus:
                      <span>G</span>
(I am happy without you)
                       <span>D</span>
I am trying to forget you
                       <span>A</span>
And everything we've had 
                       <span>G</span>
(We didn't stand a chance)
                       <span>D</span>
When miserable it is true
                        <span>A</span>
We haven't learned a thing
              <span>G</span>             <span>D</span>     <span>F#</span>
But now I know I'll trust no one else




- Bridge:

<span>G</span>            <span>D</span>                 <span>A</span>
There was a time when we were back and forth
<span>A</span>
It wasn't easy 
<span>G</span>              <span>D</span>               <span>A</span>
I guess we're back where we belong
<span>Bm</span>                            <span>A</span>     <span>G</span>
One thing is for sure it wasn't strong




- Chorus:

<span>G</span>                     <span>D</span>
I'll see you on the outside
                         <span>A</span>
Where we can both feel sane
                           <span>G</span>
(You've never been more right)

                      <span>D</span>
I am dying on the inside 
                      <span>A</span>
You're never coming back 
                   <span>G</span>   <span>D</span>         <span>F#</span>
And now I know whatever we go through
                            
My heart is stuck with you



- Ending: <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span>  
          <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span> <span>G</span> <span>F#</span>
          <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span> <span>Bm</span>
