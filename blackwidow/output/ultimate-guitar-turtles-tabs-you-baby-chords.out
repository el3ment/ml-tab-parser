The album 'You Baby' in '66
didn't make the top 100 charts. But if memory serves, 
the single did.

#1.
<span>G</span>                     <span>Bm</span>
From the time I fall asleep,
        <span>C</span>                 <span>D</span>            <span>G</span>   <span>Bm</span>  <span>C</span> <span>D</span>
til the morning comes,..I dream about..you baby.
      <span>G</span>        <span>Bm</span>
And I feel all right,
        <span>C</span>    <span>D</span>                     <span>G</span>   <span>Bm</span>   <span>C</span> <span>G</span>
cause I know tonight I’ll be with..you baby.
<span>Bm</span>               <span>Am</span>
And who makes me feel like smiling,
         <span>C</span>            <span>D</span>
when the weary day is through?

CHORUS:
<span>G</span>   <span>C</span>     <span>D</span>    <span>C</span>          <span>G</span>    <span>C</span>     <span>D</span>          <span>G</span>
You baby, you..no one but you, baby..nobody but you. (x2)

#2.
         <span>G</span>        <span>Bm</span>
They say candy is sweet,
       <span>C</span>          <span>D</span>             <span>G</span>   <span>Bm</span>   <span>C</span> <span>D</span>
but it just can’t compete with..you baby.
           <span>G</span>            <span>Bm</span>
You’ve got everything I need,
    <span>C</span>          <span>D</span>               <span>G</span>   <span>Bm</span>   <span>C</span> <span>D</span>
And nobody can please like you do, baby.
<span>Bm</span>                      <span>Am</span>
And who believes all my wildest dreams,
       <span>C</span>                          <span>D</span>
and my craziest schemes will come true?

CHORUS:(x2)

BRIDGE:
<span>G</span>                         <span>C</span>               <span>G</span>
A little ray of sunshine..A little bit of soul.
<span>G</span>                                      <span>Am</span>       <span>Bm</span>
Add just a touch of magic..You got the greatest thing
      <span>C</span>        <span>D</span>
since rock ‘n’ roll!

CHORUS:(x3)

A sixties smash from Kraziekhat.
