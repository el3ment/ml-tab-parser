Intro: <span>C#m</span>  <span>C</span>  <span>G</span>  A*

<span>C#m</span>      <span>C</span>                 <span>G</span>                      A*                         <span>C#m</span>
Mind over money  bent over backwards light up my life like a very last cigarette,

<span>C#m</span>         <span>C</span>                       <span>G</span>                      A*
time after time, dear, we will just lie here, staring at ceilings it doesn't relly matter

<span>C#m</span>
where we are

<span>C</span>  <span>G</span>  A*

<span>C#m</span>       <span>C</span>                      <span>G</span>                           A*                         
Wearing a smile like it's going out of style, look at your self, oh

                    <span>C#m</span>
there's nothing in there

<span>C#m</span>                  <span>C</span>                                  <span>G</span>                    A* 
Just put points on a grave stone, can you see yourself sinking, staring at ceilings 

                          <span>C#m</span>
it doesn't really matter where you are

<span>C</span>  <span>G</span>  A*

<span>A</span>       <span>D</span>              <span>E</span>     <span>D</span>     <span>A</span>                <span>D</span>
That's alright,  i warned myself, there's blood on the inside,

   <span>E</span>           <span>D</span>                 
but nowhere else, 

<span>A</span>       <span>D</span>              <span>E</span>     <span>D</span>     <span>A</span>                <span>D</span>
 
up on a shelf, that's where i need to be,
 
   <span>E</span>           <span>D</span> 
la da da dee

<span>C#m</span>           <span>C</span>                            <span>G</span>                     A*
I need to get something, I can't sleep for red eye, internal combustion, 

                 <span>C#m</span>   
can that really happen?

<span>C#m</span>       <span>C</span>                      <span>G</span>                   A*                    <span>C#m</span> 
I take it back, yeah, whatever I did, yeah, I didn't mean it, I was only joking

<span>C</span>  <span>G</span>  A*

<span>C#m</span>             <span>C</span>                   <span>G</span>                       A*                    <span>C#m</span> 
What does this matter in the grand scheming sky, all that I multiply adds up to nothing


<span>A</span>       <span>D</span>              <span>E</span>     <span>D</span>     <span>A</span>                <span>D</span>
That's alright,  i warned myself, there's blood on the inside,

   <span>E</span>           <span>D</span>                 
but nowhere else, 

<span>A</span>       <span>D</span>              <span>E</span>     <span>D</span>     <span>A</span>                <span>D</span>
 
up on a shelf, that's where i need to be,
 
   <span>E</span>           <span>D</span> 
la da da dee

Outro: <span>C#m</span>  <span>C</span>  <span>G</span>  A*

* this actually isn't a real A major chord, it sounds quite better if you play it with G string sounding
like G, free from your index ;)
Keep on playing also A string and avoid E, like a real A major chord!
