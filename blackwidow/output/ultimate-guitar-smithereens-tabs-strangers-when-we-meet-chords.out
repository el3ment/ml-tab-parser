         <span>D</span>                                       <span>Em</span>            <span>C</span>

Verse 2: <span>D</span>                                               <span>Em</span>       <span>C</span>
         I never really thought that she'd leave him her home and family
         <span>D</span>                                               <span>Em</span>
         I've got my whole life you still got your wife she whispered 
         <span>C</span>
         tenderly

Chorus:  <span>C</span>                    <span>D</span>   <span>Bm</span>              <span>Em</span>
         Please don't look my way when you see me on the street
         <span>C</span>                <span>D</span>                 <span>G</span>
         We will still be strangers when we meet.

Bridge:  <span>Em</span>                  <span>D</span>              <span>Em</span>                  <span>D</span>   
         All throughout this troubled time, times I wished that you were   mine
         <span>Em</span>                  <span>D</span>                 <span>G</span>
         Spend my nights and days thinking of you 
         <span>Em</span>              <span>D</span>             <span>Em</span>                <span>D</span>   
         Sometimes lie awake at night, think of you and its alright
         <span>Em</span>                  <span>D</span>                <span>Bm</span>   <span>D</span>
         Spend my nights and days thinking of you, you
