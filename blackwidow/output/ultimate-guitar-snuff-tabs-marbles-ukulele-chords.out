come the day i lose my marbles
<span>C</span>              <span>G</span>
walk me gently to the stables
<span>C</span>           <span>G</span>     <span>F</span>
sit me in a comfy sofa
<span>C</span>        <span>G</span>      <span>C</span>
wheel me out to graze

<span>C</span>                  <span>F</span>
when i'm dragged before the jury
<span>C</span>               <span>G</span>
plead for me if i'm deemed worthy
<span>C</span>                <span>G</span>       <span>F</span>
steal a song and sing it backwards
<span>C</span>              <span>G</span>         <span>C</span>
yodel till the cows come home

<span>F</span>
1 you'll get a bag of clues
<span>C</span>
2 do you need much more
   <span>G</span>                              <span>C</span>
or 3 do you just want to play the numbers
<span>F</span>
4 you'll get it on a plate
<span>C</span>                 <span>G</span>
5, 6, 7 and 8 all said one skeleton is all you're getting
better rattle it along while it's got
a bit of muscle on it

(and so on.....)

when it comes my time to snuff it
play complete control and abide with me
fill a pine bungalow with whiskey
shove me where the sun don't shine

come the day i lose my marbles
lead me gently out to graze
steal a song and sing it sideways
yodel till the cows come home
just want to play the numbers

do you
do you want to play the numbers
