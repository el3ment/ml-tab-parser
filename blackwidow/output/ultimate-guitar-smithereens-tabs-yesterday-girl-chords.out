  from "11"(1989)

  Tune down one half step.

                <span>A</span>               <span>D</span>             <span>G</span>        <span>A</span>    |<span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>G</span> <span>A</span>|
      I never think about the future, I just live for today
                  <span>A</span>             <span>D</span>              <span>G</span>         <span>A</span>  |<span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>G</span> <span>A</span>|
      And if you want a ready answer I've got nothing to say
                       <span>A</span>             <span>D</span>                 <span>G</span>          <span>A</span>
      So please don't bother talking to me, I'll just disappoint you
                   <span>A</span>                <span>D</span>                   <span>G</span>         <span>A</span>
      Because I'm quite content to sit right here with nothing to do

      Pre-chorus:

            <span>E</span>            <span>A</span>              <span>D</span>       <span>E</span>   |<span>E</span> <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>E</span>|
      Well,I'm not the singer that you used to know
         <span>E</span>              <span>A</span>               <span>D</span>        <span>E</span>  |<span>E</span> <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>E</span>|
      I used to be the guy that had someplace to go

      Chorus:
                         <span>A</span>          <span>D</span>     <span>G</span>          <span>A</span>
           But that was yesterday, girl, Yesterday, girl
            <span>A</span>         <span>D</span>    <span>G</span>         <span>A</span>                   
           Yesterday,girl,Yesterday girl
                            <span>A</span>         <span>D</span>
           (and you're my) yesterday girl,
            <span>G</span>         <span>A</span>     <span>A</span>         <span>D</span>      <span>G</span>        <span>A</span>
           Yesterday girl, yesterday girl, yesterday girl

       I never want to find an answer cause I don't like the truth
       And if I find just what I'm looking for I've something to lose
       So please don't go and ask me questions I just won't feel the same
       (I'll do what you say, doesn't matter anyway)
       And when I think about religion well there's no-one to blame
       (I'm not feelin' you, doesn't matter what I do)

       Pre-chorus,Chorus, Solo.

       (tell me something new, then I might agree with you)
       (I live for today,not yesterday!)

       Repeat first verse,chorus, end on A.
