%%%% Tab:<i></i>You Know Waht I Mean:The Turtles.
#12 in 1967.

INTRO:<span>E</span> <span>F#</span> <span>E</span> <span>F#</span> <span>B</span>

#1.
<span>E</span>                <span>F#</span>           <span>E</span>               <span>F#</span>
Shouldn't we two be together, you know what I mean.
   <span>A</span>              <span>D</span>                <span>G</span>                      <span>E</span>
To be with you is something like a dream, you know what I mean?
           <span>A</span>       <span>D</span>              <span>A</span>        <span>D</span>       <span>G</span>     <span>E</span>
And if you want me to, I'll bring sunshine to you, only.

#2.
           <span>E</span>            <span>F#</span>              <span>E</span>           <span>F#</span>
You better stop, take a look about, you know what I mean?
   <span>A</span>              <span>D</span>                   <span>G</span>               <span>E</span>
If only you could see the dreams that seem to mean so much to me.
           <span>A</span>               <span>D</span>           <span>A</span>              <span>E</span>
Then you'd know the reason why I would rather say, 'I do' than say
    <span>D</span>                           <span>B</span>                  <span>B7</span>
goodbye and let you go forever, wouldn't we two be together?

CHORUS:
<span>E</span>         <span>F#</span>       <span>E</span>      <span>F#</span>            <span>A</span>
Can't you see that I want you for me forever,
<span>C#7</span>                <span>F#</span>
wouldn't we two be together?
<span>B</span>                  <span>C#7</span>                     <span>B</span>           <span>C#7</span>
Do you know what I mean, can't you read in between the lines,
              <span>E</span>              <span>A</span>                <span>D</span>    <span>B</span>
sometimes I'm talking and it doesn't seem too clear.
           <span>E</span>       <span>A</span>
But if you have to know,
       <span>E</span>            <span>A</span>               <span>E</span>    <span>F#</span>
I'm in love if only you know what I mean.

OUTRO:
<span>E</span>                  <span>F#</span>
Do you know what I mean? (x6)
