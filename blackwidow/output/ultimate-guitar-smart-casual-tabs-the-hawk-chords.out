Have you ever wondered          if Stephen Hawkin and Jennifer Hawkins

<span>Am</span>                           <span>G</span>
find each other sexually attractive?
<span>F</span>               <span>Cmaj7</span>  <span>Am</span>                 <span>G</span>
and if they did        do you think they would act on it?
<span>F</span>                      <span>Cmaj7</span>  <span>Am</span>                 <span>G</span>
and if they did act on it would they use protection?
                               <span>F</span>                 <span>Cmaj7</span>  <span>Am</span>     
and if they didn't use protection and they had a child a boy
           <span>G</span>            <span>F</span>   <span>Cmaj7</span>      <span>Am</span>                 <span>G</span>        <span>G</span>
do you think that maybe..   just maybe.. they would call him the hawk?

         <span>F</span>
he's the hawk 
    <span>Cmaj7</span>
the hawk
<span>Am</span>        <span>G</span>
he's hawk hawkins
         <span>F</span>
he's the hawk
    <span>Cmaj7</span> 
the hawk
  <span>Am</span>      <span>G</span>   
he's hawk hawkins

<span>F</span>                      <span>Cmaj7</span>  <span>Am</span>                 <span>G</span>                         
     and do you think that after all their sexual chemistry has worn off
<span>F</span>                     <span>Cmaj7</span>     <span>Am</span>               <span>G</span>              
that they would have enough in common to stay together?
 <span>F</span>                                 <span>Cmaj7</span>                
and if they didn't and if they got divorced
 <span>Am</span>               <span>G</span>                                        
who then would take sole custody of the hawk?

                           <span>F</span>
who's gonna look after the hawk?
    <span>Cmaj7</span>

                      <span>Am</span>

     <span>Cmaj7</span>
the hawk
                      <span>Am</span>

<span>F</span>     <span>Cmaj7</span>            <span>Am</span>       <span>G</span>                   <span>F</span>
      and do you think the hawk just like his mother
          <span>Cmaj7</span>                     <span>Am</span>              <span>G</span>
would be the most attractive person in the entire universe?

<span>F</span>                  <span>Cmaj7</span>            <span>Am</span>       <span>G</span>              <span>F</span>
and do you think the hawk just like his father would be the smartest person
          <span>Cmaj7</span>         <span>Am</span>      <span>G</span>
 in the entire universe?
                                  
                <span>F</span>             <span>Cmaj7</span>                    <span>Am</span> 
or do you think maybe things wouldn't work out that way.. 

        <span>G</span>           <span>F</span>          <span>F</span>(i)        <span>F</span>          <span>F</span>(i)       
and the hawk would just be a little boy in a wheelchair
    <span>F</span>          <span>F</span>(i)        <span>F</span>     <span>F</span>(i)
with the mind of a supermodel?

                      <span>F</span>
who's gonna push the hawk?
    <span>Cmaj7</span>

                <span>Am</span>
