#1 in 1967.
  (Capo 2nd fret for original.)

#1.
<span>Em</span>
Imagine me and you, I do.
                  <span>D</span>
I think about you day and night, it's only right,
                   <span>C</span>
to think about the girl you love and hold her tight,
         <span>B7</span>
So happy together.

#2.
<span>Em</span> 
If I should call you up, invest a dime,
                <span>D</span>
And you say you belong to me, and ease my mind,
                <span>C</span>
Imagine how the world could be, so very fine,
         <span>B7</span>
So happy together.

CHORUS:
<span>E</span>              <span>Bm</span>                <span>E</span>               <span>G</span>
I can't see me lovin' nobody but you, for all my life.
<span>E</span>                    <span>Bm</span>                   <span>E</span>
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue,
           <span>G</span>
For all my life.

#3.
<span>Em</span>
Me and you and you and me,
                   <span>D</span>
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be.
                 <span>C</span>
The only one for me is you, and you for me,
         <span>B7</span>
So happy together.

CHORUS:

REPEAT:#3.

<span>E</span>           <span>Bm</span>                <span>E</span>           <span>G</span>
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba..
<span>E</span>           <span>Bm</span>                <span>E</span>           <span>G</span>
