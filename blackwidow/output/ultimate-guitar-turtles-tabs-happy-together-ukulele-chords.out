	Imagine me and you, I do
	                   <span>E</span>
	I think about you day and night, it's only right
	                    <span>D</span>
	To think about the girl you love  and hold her tight
	           <span>C#</span>
	So happy together

Verse 2:

	If I should call you up, invest a dime

	Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
	So happy together

Chorus:

	<span>F#</span>              <span>C#m</span>              <span>F#</span>
	I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
	            <span>A</span>
	For all my life
	<span>F#</span>                   <span>C#m</span>                   <span>F#</span>
	When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue
	            <span>A</span>
	For all my life

Verse 3:
