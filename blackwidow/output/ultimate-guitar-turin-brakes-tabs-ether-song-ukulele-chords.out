In the morning, in the morning rain.
        <span>D</span>  <span>Bm</span>       <span>D</span> <span>Bm</span>   <span>C</span>
In the binary of a data stream

<span>A</span>-ahhh...........

On an airplane, on a radio
       <span>D</span>   <span>C</span>          <span>D</span>  <span>Bm</span>     <span>C</span>
All around me, In the ether's flow

<span>D</span>          <span>C</span>          <span>D</span>      <span>Bm</span>   <span>C</span>

<span>Cadd9</span>            <span>C</span>
Oooooooooooooooooh


<span>Cadd9</span>             <span>C</span>
Under an orange sun
<span>Cadd9</span>        <span>C</span>          <span>Em</span>
Running from what I've become

<span>Cadd9</span>            <span>C</span>
Oooooooooooooooooh
<span>Cadd9</span> (fingerpick)                  <span>C</span>

<span>D</span>                <span>C</span>            
You can't take a photograph of it at night
     <span>D</span>           <span>Bm</span>          <span>C</span>
It lives in the code of a firefly buzzing
     <span>D</span>                <span>C</span>  
It vibrates through brick walls, keeping their time
     <span>D</span>           <span>Bm</span>       <span>C</span>
It cuddles the creeping chaos coming
   <span>D</span>            <span>C</span>
I see it more clearly than ever before
     <span>D</span>         <span>Bm</span>       <span>C</span>
I'm in it's invisible river flowing
         <span>D</span>               <span>C</span>
Through everything I've ever been through before
      <span>D</span>              <span>Bm</span>       <span>C</span>
Heads up, somethings really happening....
<span>D</span>      <span>C</span>
Ooooooo............
<span>D</span>  <span>Bm</span>    <span>C</span>
Ooooooo............
