<span>G</span>                       <span>C</span>                    <span>Bm</span>
Cubscouts are screaming,  Needing icecream and all the pleasures

     <span>D</span>    <span>G</span>                   <span>C</span>                        <span>Bm</span>
of June. I'm in a parked car flowers seem friendly and people in

               <span>D</span>      <span>G</span>                     <span>C</span>
hallways feel walls.  Now it is night time, maybe we're cruising


 <span>Bm</span>                <span>D</span>           <span>G</span>            <span>C</span>             <span>Bm</span>
avoiding the anti cruise. oh i don't really know where we are.

If things get real promise to take me somewhere else_______

<span>D</span>      <span>Am</span>                  <span>C</span>                     <span>Bm</span>      <span>D</span>
By the time fear takes me over will we still be roll____ing

                       <span>G</span>         <span>C</span>      <span>Bm</span>  <span>D</span>  (back to verse riff)

<follows same pattern for rest of song including leave me... bit:>

      <span>G</span>     <span>C</span>      <span>Bm</span>  <span>D</span>     <span>G</span>     <span>C</span>        <span>Bm</span>    <span>D</span>
