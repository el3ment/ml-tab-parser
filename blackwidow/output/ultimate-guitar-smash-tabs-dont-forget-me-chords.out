They thought they could dispose of me
<span>A</span>
They tried to make me small
<span>E</span>
I suffered each indignity
<span>A</span>
But now rise above it all

<span>C#m</span>
Yes, the price I paid was all I had
<span>A</span>
But at last, I found release
        <span>D</span>
And if something good can come from bad
<span>A</span>
The past can rest in peace

<span>E</span>
Oh if you see someone's hurt

And in need of a hand
<span>A</span>
Don't forget me
<span>E</span>
Or hear a melody crying from some baby grand
<span>A</span>
You don't forget me

<span>C#m</span>
When you sing happy birthday to someone you love
<span>A</span>
Or see diamonds you wish were all free
<span>E</span>
Please say that you won't;
<span>B</span>                            <span>E</span>
I pray that you don't forget me

<span>F</span>
But forget every man who I ever met
             <span>Bb</span>
'Cause they only lived to control
<span>F</span>
For a kiss they paid a thousand
          <span>Bb</span>
Yet they paid fifty cents for my soul

<span>Dm</span>
They took their piece
<span>Bb</span>
The price of fame that no one can repay
<span>D#</span>
Ah, but they didn't buy me when they bought my name
      <span>C</span> 
And that is why I pray

<span>F</span>
That when you see someone's hurt

And in need of a hand
     <span>Bb</span>
You don't forget me
<span>F</span>
Or hear a melody crying from some baby grand
     <span>Bb</span>
You don't forget me

<span>Dm</span>
When you sing happy birthday to someone you love
        <span>Bb</span>
Or see diamonds you wish were all free
<span>F</span>
Please say that you won't;
<span>C</span>                     <span>F</span>
I pray that you don't forget me

<span>Bb</span>
There are some in this world who have strength on their own
<span>F</span>
Never broken or in need of repair
<span>C#</span>
But there are some born to shine who can't do it alone
<span>D#</span>                               <span>F</span>
So protect them and take special care
<span>F#</span>
Take care

<span>F#</span>
And don't forget me
<span>B</span>
Please take care
<span>F#</span>
And don't forget me
<span>D#m</span>
When you look to the heavens with someone you love
<span>B</span>
And a light shining bright from afar
<span>F#</span>
Hope you see my face there
<span>C#</span>
And then offer a prayer
<span>Bm</span>
And please let me be
<span>F#</span>
Let me be that star
