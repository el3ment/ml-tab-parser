<span>C</span>
Tearing out this page 
               <span>G</span>
It’s so hard to write 
       <span>Am</span>                             <span>F</span>
Try to block out these thoughts in my mind 
                  <span>C</span>
Wonder if they’ll fade
                  <span>G</span> 
These memories of mine
      <span>Am</span>                  <span>F</span>
Maybe they will wear over time 

   <span>Am</span>   <span>G</span>      <span>C</span>
I often find myself 
            <span>F</span>        <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>
thinking of you from time to time 

         <span>C</span>
Remember back to all those summers 

Where we would spend all day 
        <span>F</span>
Stay up late and talk for hours 
       <span>G</span>
Always knew just what to say 
             <span>C</span>
But then you went and found another 

What we had is dead and gone 
           <span>F</span>                  <span>G</span>
Although I think I’m starting to 
             <span>C</span>
Finally move on 

<span>C</span>
I know you’ve got your friends 
                       <span>G</span>
You know that I’ve got mine
       <span>Am</span>                     <span>F</span> 
I look forward to seeing them online
                 <span>C</span> 
But you’re never there
             <span>G</span> 
I wait for a sign
            <span>Am</span>                       <span>F</span> 
I just keep telling myself I’m doing fine 

   <span>Am</span>   <span>G</span>      <span>C</span>
I often find myself 
            <span>F</span>        <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>

Finally move on 

  <span>Am</span>                <span>F</span>
I can’t deny what I felt inside
      <span>C</span>                               <span>G</span> 
But I think it’s time I finally moved on
      <span>Am</span>                   <span>F</span> 
And I wonder when I’ll see you again 
               <span>G</span>
Where have you gone
