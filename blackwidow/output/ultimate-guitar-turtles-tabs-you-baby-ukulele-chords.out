You Baby chords
The Turtles

<span>F</span> <span>G</span> <span>F</span> <span>F</span>  2x

         <span>F</span>            <span>G</span>
From the time I fall asleep
        <span>F</span>               <span>G</span>        
Til the morning comes I dream about
<span>F</span>   <span>G</span>  <span>F</span> <span>G</span>
You baby
      <span>F</span>        <span>G</span>
And I feel all right
        <span>F</span>      <span>G</span>
Cause I know tonight I ll be with
<span>F</span>   <span>F</span>  <span>G</span> <span>F</span>
You baby
<span>Em</span>               <span>F</span>
And who makes me feel like smiling
                      <span>G</span>
When the weary day is through

<span>F</span>   <span>F</span>     <span>G</span>  <span>F</span>       <span>F</span>    <span>F</span>     <span>G</span>          <span>F</span>
You baby, no-one but you, baby, nobody but you 2X

         <span>F</span>        <span>G</span>
They say candy is sweet
       <span>F</span>             <span>G</span>
But it just can t compete with
<span>F</span>   <span>G</span>  <span>F</span> <span>G</span>
You baby
           <span>F</span>            <span>G</span>
You ve got everything I need
      <span>F</span>        <span>G</span>
And nobody can please like
<span>F</span>       <span>F</span>   <span>G</span> <span>F</span>
You do, baby
<span>Em</span>                      <span>F</span>
And who believes all my wildest dreams
                                  <span>G</span>
And my craziest schemes will come true

<span>F</span>   <span>F</span>     <span>G</span>  <span>F</span>       <span>F</span>    <span>F</span>     <span>G</span>          <span>F</span>
You baby, no-one but you, baby, nobody but you 2X

  <span>F</span>
A little ray of sunshine

A little bit of soul

Add just a touch of magic
            <span>F</span>                    <span>G</span>
You got the greatest thing since rock n roll

<span>F</span>   <span>F</span>     <span>G</span>  <span>F</span>       <span>F</span>    <span>F</span>     <span>G</span>          <span>F</span>
You baby, no-one but you, baby, nobody but you 4X
