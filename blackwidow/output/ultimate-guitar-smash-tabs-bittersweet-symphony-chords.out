%%%% Tab:<i></i>This is the version of Bittersweet Symphony sung by Megan Hilty which was played on the
TV show SMASH. This is probably my favorite cover of the song so I decided to figure out
the chords for it. This is my first time but Iâ€™m about 90% certain that this is correct 
(I have a good ear lol). If Bm7 is a struggle Bm works fine as well. Good luck and enjoy =]

Capo on 4th fret.

Intro: <span>E</span>   <span>Esus</span>| <span>Bm7</span>   <span>A</span>|

              <span>E</span>     <span>Em7</span>   <span>Bm7</span>   <span>A</span>        <span>E</span>    <span>Em7</span> <span>Bm7</span> <span>A</span>
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
       <span>E</span>         <span>Em7</span>
Try to make ends meet

You're a slave to money then you die
              <span>E</span>        <span>Em7</span>  <span>Bm7</span>       <span>A</span>         <span>E</span>    <span>Em7</span> <span>Bm7</span> <span>A</span>
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
             <span>E</span>        <span>Em7</span>              <span>Bm7</span>
You know the one that takes you to the places
      <span>A</span>             <span>E</span>         <span>Em7</span> <span>Bm7</span> <span>A</span>
where all the veins meet yeah,

<span>E</span>                <span>Em7</span>
No change, I can change
      <span>Bm7</span>           <span>A</span>
I can change, I can change
        <span>E</span>          <span>Em7</span>
But I'm here in my mold
     <span>Bm7</span>        <span>A</span>
I am here in my mold
          <span>E</span>                  <span>Em7</span>
But I'm a million different people
     <span>Bm7</span>            <span>A</span>
from one day to the next
        <span>E</span>
I can't change my mold
<span>Em7</span>     <span>Bm7</span>     <span>A</span>
No, no, no, no, no

<span>E</span>    <span>Em7</span>|  <span>Bm7</span>   <span>A</span>| x1

       <span>E</span>     <span>Em7</span>
Well I never pray

          <span>E</span>        <span>Em7</span>         <span>Bm7</span>       <span>A</span>          <span>E</span>       <span>Em7</span> <span>Bm7</span> <span>A</span>
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
         <span>E</span>          <span>Em7</span>                      <span>Bm7</span>    <span>A</span>                <span>E</span>      <span>Em7</span> <span>Bm7</span> <span>A</span>
But the airways are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

I can change, I can change
        <span>E</span>          <span>Em7</span>
But I'm here in my mold
     <span>Bm7</span>        <span>A</span>
I am here in my mold
          <span>E</span>                 <span>Em7</span>
