The correct version :)

Verse 1:
<span>Em</span>
Six billion backs against the wall
          <span>D</span> <span>Dsus2</span> <span>C</span> 
Now do we walk or run
<span>Em</span>
This puzzles falling into place
           <span>D</span>   <span>Dsus2</span> <span>C</span>    
Once more around the sun
<span>A</span>
Remember when you where a kid 
                       <span>C</span>
Those days were all so long

Chorus:
<span>Em</span>            <span>D</span>   <span>C</span>
But if we don't do this      
<span>A</span>             <span>C</span>             
Somebody else will

Verse 2:
Three billion backs againts the wall 
A prayer for everyone
We saw the changing of the sea 
But not a thing was done
Remember when you could rely 
Those days are all but gone

Chorus:
<span>Em</span>            <span>D</span>   <span>C</span>
But if we don't do this      
<span>A</span>             <span>C</span>             
Somebody else will
<span>Em</span>            <span>D</span>   <span>C</span>
If we don't do this      
<span>A</span>             <span>C</span>             
Somebody else will
<span>D</span>             <span>Em</span>             
Somebody else will

Verse 3:
One billion backs againts the wall
At least our feet were dry
I was an island to myself
This storm would pass me but
Remembering the things I did
I knew i would survive

Chorus:
But if we don't do this            
Somebody else will
If we don't do this      
Somebody else will   
Somebody else will

Verse 4:
One million backs against the wall
Now do we walk or run
One thousand backs agiants the wall 
Now do we walk or run
One hundred backs against the wall 
Now do we walk or run
Its just your back against the wall
Now do you walk or run
Remember when you were a kid
Those days are all but gone

Chorus:
And if we don't do this    
Nobody else will
And if we don't do this    
Nobody else will
Nobody else will
