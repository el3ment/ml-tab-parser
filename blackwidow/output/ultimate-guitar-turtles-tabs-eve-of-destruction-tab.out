intro
D

verses
   D                           G
(1)the Eastern world           it is exploding
(2)dont you understand         what im trying to say
(3)think of all the hate       there is in red china

   violence flaring and        bullets loading
   and cant you feel the fears that im feeling today
   then take a look around     to selma alabama

   youre old enough to kill    but not for voting
   if the button is pushed     theres no running away
   you may leave here          for four days in space

   you dont believe in war     but whats that gun youre toting
   theyll be know one to save  with tha world in a grave
   but when you return         its the same old place

   even the jordan river       has bodies floating
   take a look around you boy  its bound to scare you boy
   the pounding of the drums   the pride and disgrace

(3)you can bury your dead      but dont leave a trace
  hate your next door neighbor but dont forget to say grace

coda
D

mcguire version

G                            G          A
yer my bloods so mad         feels like coagulating
im sitting here              just contemplating
i cant twist the truth       it knows no regulation
hand full of sedatives       dont pass legislation
and marches alone            cant bring integration
when human respect is        disintegrating
this whole crazy world       is just to frustrating
