Intro - [<span>A#m</span> <span>A#m</span> <span>A#m</span> <span>D#m</span>] x 1

Verse 1
					  <span>A#m</span> 
It just hit the season everyone breeding, slap on my face elevate my breathing 

<span>A#m</span> 					      <span>D#m</span>
I just got to see her so I’m off and leaving, tracks wind back to the coliseum 

<span>A#m</span> 				      <span>A#m</span> 
the villagers and aristocrats uneasy, Horde for the spectacle they want to see me 

<span>A#m</span> 					       <span>D#m</span>
The sun done shine as they take their seating, Arms in the air wave em round like sea weed 

<span>A#m</span> 				     <span>A#m</span> 
and nothing be as good as you chick, We got a special unique loose fit 

<span>A#m</span> 					      <span>D#m</span>
and everything we do is to prove we tuned in, We sticking to each other like paper to glue stick

<span>A#m</span> 				     <span>A#m</span> 
Reminds me of kittens and newspaper, slipping in and out of it all like two vapours 

<span>A#m</span> 					 <span>D#m</span>
intertwined and we smoke ring crusaders, caught in a crux I’m calling it love and 

<span>A#m</span> 				     <span>A#m</span> 
all the above and below the surface, This contact sport got me sort of nervous 

<span>A#m</span> 					<span>D#m</span>
Bliss and a little bit of soda purpose, likely to cause all sorts of hurt ….. Let’s go.

Chorus

<span>A#m</span>                                 <span>Fm</span>
One thing that I really want to do, get close and personal with you 

<span>D#m</span>                                <span>A#m</span> 
That’s one thing I just got to do,........eh, eh, eh 

<span>A#m</span>                                      <span>Fm</span>
caught deep in the deepness of the blue, I’m sick from the sweetness off of you

<span>D#m</span>                              <span>A#m</span>
Your one thing I just got to do, ........eh ,eh ,eh

Verse 2

[Guitar break x2]
You got class like red wine and soul tunes 
and when you laugh you can light up a whole room 
You play your mind like a beautiful instrument 
cut a fool down to size with your intellect 

yeah I know you’re kind of scared of gettin intimate
we both hold back from really getting in to this 
Well let’s risk it and see what come 
because we stick together like bass line to bass drum 
 
[<span>A#m</span> <span>A#m</span> <span>A#m</span> <span>D#m</span>]
I know you got a lot to do love
we all do love lookin for true love 
and ain’t it just like love to get you confused love 
win and lose love well then we’ll make new Love 

[<span>A#m</span> <span>A#m</span> <span>A#m</span> <span>D#m</span>]
And we all run from something so strong
we give up but then we get back on 
We both get busy with a lot to do 
But if you’d like well I’d like to do a lot with you 
so c’mon.

Chorus - [<span>A#m</span> <span>Fm</span> <span>D#m</span> <span>A#m</span>] x 4

[<span>A#m</span> <span>Fm</span> <span>D#m</span> <span>A#m</span>] x 2

[<span>A#m</span> <span>Fm</span> <span>D#m</span> <span>A#m</span>] 
Sometimes it’s early in the morning 
outside the sun is shining so we just stay in bed
The world is ours we can pretend 

[<span>A#m</span> <span>Fm</span> <span>D#m</span> <span>A#m</span>]
Sometimes it’s late into the evening 
we are silent we ain’t speaking 
because nothing can be said 
round and round it goes again... 

Chorus - [<span>A#m</span> <span>Fm</span> <span>D#m</span> <span>A#m</span>] x 4
