                      (Gary Bonner - Alan Gordon)

Intro:

	 <span>E</span>        <span>F#7</span>          <span>E</span>

Verse 1:

	 <span>E</span>               <span>F#7</span>
	Shouldn't we two be together
	 <span>E</span>               <span>F#7</span>
	You know what I mean
	   <span>A</span>               <span>D</span>                 <span>G</span>                     <span>E</span>
	To be with you is something like a dream (you know what I mean)
	            <span>A</span>      <span>D</span>
	And if you want me to
	            <span>A</span>       <span>D</span>       <span>G</span>
	I'll bring sunshine to you only

Verse 2:

	            <span>E</span> [N.<span>C</span>.]    <span>F#7</span>
	You better stop, take a look about
	     <span>E</span>           <span>F#7</span>
	You know what I mean
	    <span>A</span>              <span>D</span>                   <span>G</span>               <span>E</span>
	If only you could see the dreams that seem to mean so much to me
	            <span>A</span>               <span>D</span>
	Then you'd know the reason why
	         <span>A</span>         <span>E</span>
	I would love to "I do" than say
	     <span>D</span>       <span>A</span>      <span>D</span>      <span>A</span>
	Goodbye and let you go forever
	 <span>B/F#</span>
	Wouldn't we two be together

Bridge:

	 <span>E</span>        <span>F#</span>       <span>E</span>       <span>F#</span>
	Can't you see that I want you
	    <span>A</span>
	For me forever
	 <span>C#</span>                   <span>F#</span>
	Wouldn't we two be together

Verse 3:

	<span>B</span>                   <span>C#</span>                  <span>B</span>               <span>C#</span>
	Do you know what I mean, can't you read in between the lines
	               <span>E</span>              <span>A</span>                 <span>D</span>      <span>B</span>
	Sometimes I'm talking and it doesn't seem too clear
	            <span>E</span>       <span>A</span>
	But if you have to know
	        E            B                E / / /  / / F# /
	I'm in love if only you know what I mean
