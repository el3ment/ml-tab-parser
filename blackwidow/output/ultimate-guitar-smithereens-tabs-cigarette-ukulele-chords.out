Here's a song from the Smithereens, ESPECIALLY FOR YOU album. This is
indeed my first time posting so if y'all got any comments, please tell me
before i get into a bad habit! Like I said, I'm really clueless so if
this winds up in pub/guitar/s/smithereens I would be most gracious!

                             Cigarette
(intro)
<span>G</span>//|<span>D</span>//|<span>E</span>//|<span>F#</span>//|
(verse1)
<span>A</span>              <span>E</span>           <span>G</span>                <span>D</span>
smoked my last cigarette, sat in bed for a while,
<span>F</span>               <span>C</span>             <span>D</span>            <span>E</span>
thought of your face and that brought me a smile,
<span>A</span>       <span>E</span>           <span>G</span>          <span>D</span>
wanted another one, fell back asleep instead,
<span>F</span>              <span>C</span>           <span>D</span>            <span>E</span>
woke and found you sitting there on the bed

(chorus)
<span>G</span>          <span>D</span>          <span>A</span>          <span>E</span>
cigarette, cigarette, burning up time.
<span>G</span>          <span>D</span>          <span>A</span>          <span>E</span>
cigarette, cigarette, watch the  smoke climb.
<span>G</span>          <span>D</span>          <span>A</span>          <span>E</span>
cigarette, cigarette, wasting    away...
<span>G</span>              <span>D</span>          <span>A</span>           <span>E</span>
just like this cigarette, our time is running down,
<span>G</span>        <span>D</span>                <span>E</span>            <span>F#</span>
only one hour 'til you're leavin' this town.

(bridge)
<span>G</span>    <span>D</span>    <span>A</span>    <span>E</span>
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
<span>G</span>    <span>D</span>    <span>A</span>    <span>E</span>
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
<span>G</span>              <span>D</span>          <span>A</span>           <span>E</span>
just like this cigarette, our time is running down,
<span>G</span>        <span>D</span>                 <span>E</span>       <span>F#</span>
only one hour 'till you're leavin' this town.

(verse2)
walked to the corner store, bought us another pack,
held my arm 'round you as we headed back.
I tried to change your mind, didn't want you to go,
I love you more, I think, than you will ever know.

(repeat chorus)

(coda)
smoked one last cigarette, sat in bed for a while,
thought of your face and that brought me a smile...
