Intro: ( <span>A</span>-/<span>G</span>-<span>A</span>  <span>A</span>-/<span>G</span>-<span>A</span>  /<span>G</span>-<span>A</span>-/<span>G</span> ) x2   (<span>A</span>-/<span>G</span>-<span>A</span>-<span>D</span>-<span>F</span>-<span>E</span>) x2

            <span>A</span>       /<span>G</span>    <span>A</span>      <span>D</span>           <span>F</span>         <span>E</span>        <span>G</span>      <span>A</span>      /<span>G</span>  <span>A</span>   <span>D</span> <span>F</span> <span>E</span>
I used to travel in the shadows and I never found the nerve to try to walk up to you
     <span>A</span>       /<span>G</span> <span>A</span>   <span>D</span>                <span>F</span>         <span>E</span>       <span>G</span>              <span>A</span>      /<span>G</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>D</span> <span>F</span> <span>E</span>
But now I am a man and I know that there's no time to waste, there's too much to lose
              <span>A</span>       /<span>G</span> <span>A</span>    <span>D</span>                  <span>F</span>       <span>E</span>         <span>G</span>       <span>A</span>          /<span>G</span>   <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>F</span> <span>E</span>
Girl you say anything at all, and you know that you can call, and I'll be right there for you
 <span>A</span>        /<span>G</span> <span>A</span>     <span>D</span>         <span>F</span>       <span>E</span>      <span>G</span>         <span>A</span>        /<span>G</span>   <span>A</span>  <span>D</span> <span>F</span> <span>E</span>
First love, heartbreak, tough luck, big mistake, what else can you do?

<span>G</span>                      <span>A</span>             <span>G</span>   -    <span>D</span>     -      <span>A</span>
I'll say anything you want to hear, I'll see everything through
<span>G</span>                   <span>A</span>           <span>F</span>               <span>E</span>         <span>G</span> -  <span>D</span>    <span>A</span>  /<span>G</span> <span>A</span>
I'll do anything I have to do, just to win the love of a girl like you,   
<span>D</span> <span>F</span>   <span>E</span>   /<span>G</span>    <span>A</span>   /<span>G</span> <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>F</span> <span>E</span>
   a girl like you

        <span>A</span>          /<span>G</span>    <span>A</span>     <span>D</span>                 <span>F</span>      <span>E</span>      <span>G</span>           <span>A</span>       /<span>G</span>   <span>A</span>  <span>D</span> <span>F</span> <span>E</span>
People talk and people stare, tell them I don't really care, this is the place I should be
              <span>A</span>         /<span>G</span>      <span>A</span>     <span>D</span>                <span>F</span>      <span>E</span>      <span>G</span>        <span>A</span>       /<span>G</span>   <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>F</span> <span>E</span>
And if they think it's really strange for a girl like you, to be in love with someone like me
         <span>A</span>            /<span>G</span> <span>A</span>      <span>D</span>                <span>F</span>     <span>E</span>    <span>G</span>        <span>A</span>       /<span>G</span>   <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>F</span> <span>E</span>
I wanna tell them all to go to hell, that we're doing very well without them you see
                <span>A</span>         /<span>G</span>   <span>A</span>         <span>D</span>         <span>F</span>         <span>E</span>       <span>G</span>       <span>A</span>        /<span>G</span>   <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>F</span> <span>E</span>
That's just the way it is and they will see, I am yours and you are mine the way it should be

<span>G</span>                      <span>A</span>             <span>G</span>   -    <span>D</span>     -      <span>A</span>
I'll say anything you want to hear, I'll see everything through
<span>G</span>                   <span>A</span>           <span>F</span>               <span>E</span>         <span>G</span> -  <span>D</span>    <span>A</span>  /<span>G</span> <span>A</span>
I'll do anything I have to do, just to win the love of a girl like you,   
<span>D</span> <span>F</span>   <span>E</span>   /<span>G</span>    <span>A</span>   /<span>G</span> <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>F</span>    <span>E</span>   /<span>G</span>    <span>A</span>  /<span>G</span> <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>F</span>   <span>E</span>   /<span>G</span>    <span>A</span> /<span>G</span> <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>F</span>  <span>E</span>

Now if I seem a little wild, there's no holding back, I'm trying to get a message to you
/<span>G</span>   <span>A</span>     /<span>G</span>  <span>A</span>         /<span>G</span>   <span>A</span>      <span>A</span> /<span>G</span>     <span>A</span>       /<span>G</span> <span>A</span>        /<span>G</span>  <span>A</span>      /<span>G</span>  <span>A</span>   <span>A</span> /<span>G</span> <span>A</span>
  I won't take anything from anyone, I won't walk and I won't run, I believe in you

/<span>G</span> <span>A</span> /<span>G</span>  <span>A</span>  NC                                            <span>A</span>      /<span>G</span>   <span>A</span>  <span>D</span> <span>F</span> <span>E</span>
