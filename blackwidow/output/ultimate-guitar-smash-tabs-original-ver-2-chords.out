%%%% Tab:<i></i>Intro: <span>G</span> <span>D</span> <span>C</span> (x2)

<span>G</span>
Way back before she hit the scene
<span>G</span>
And she became the indie queen
<span>G</span>         <span>D</span>                 <span>G</span>      <span>C</span>               
She was a girl with nothing big to say
<span>G</span>
Her mouth was full of silver spoons
<span>G</span>
Singing her dime a dozen tunes
<span>G</span>                               <span>C</span>      <span>Em</span>           
'Til she came up with something new to play

<span>G</span>                  <span>D</span> 
A girl so scarred, a pain so real
<span>G</span>               <span>D</span>   
A life so hard, becomes a song you feel
<span>G</span>                         <span>D</span>
Her tracks were leaked and all the hipsters freaked
<span>G</span>        <span>D</span>         <span>C</span>  
She made herself a star

<span>G</span>          <span>D</span>          <span>C</span>
She wants, she wants, she wants to be original
<span>C</span>         <span>Em</span>       <span>D</span>
She will, she will become something remarkable
<span>G</span>          <span>D</span>          <span>C</span>
Who cares, who cares, who cares what stunt she has to pull
<span>C</span>         <span>G</span>         <span>D</span>             <span>G</span>
She'll be remade as somebody original

<span>C</span> <span>Em</span> <span>D</span>

<span>G</span>
Way back before the interviews
<span>G</span>
Before her music made the news
<span>G</span>         <span>C</span>             <span>D</span>       <span>C</span>           
She was a nothing no one talked about
<span>G</span>       <span>D</span>              <span>G</span> 
A mousy girl behind the mic
<span>G</span>
One more vanilla look-alike
<span>G</span>        <span>D</span>          <span>C</span>         
'Til she decided to stand out

<span>G</span>                           <span>D</span> 
And now it's crazy clothes, a brand new name
<span>G</span>                  <span>D</span> 
A fixed up nose and monster fame
<span>G</span>                            <span>D</span>
Though she might say that she was born this way
<span>G</span>        <span>D</span>         <span>C</span>
She made herself a star


<span>G</span>          <span>D</span>          <span>C</span>
She wants, she wants, she wants to be original
<span>C</span>         <span>Em</span>       <span>D</span>
She will, she will become something remarkable
<span>G</span>          <span>D</span>          <span>C</span>
Who cares, who cares, who cares what stunt she has to pull
<span>C</span>         <span>G</span>         <span>D</span>             <span>G</span>      <span>Am</span>
She'll be remade as somebody original

<span>Am</span>      <span>G</span>              <span>C</span>
You can wipe away everything you are
<span>A</span>         <span>G</span>      <span>D</span>     <span>C</span>
Wake up tomorrow as a star

<span>G</span>            <span>D</span>               <span>G</span>   
There was a girl who blended in
<span>G</span>            <span>Am</span>            <span>G</span>    
That was the way her life had been
<span>G</span>        <span>C</span>             <span>G</span>       <span>C</span>
'Til she decided to be someone else


<span>G</span>          <span>D</span>          <span>C</span>
She wants, she wants, she wants to be original
<span>C</span>         <span>Em</span>       <span>D</span>
She will, she will become something remarkable
<span>G</span>          <span>D</span>          <span>C</span>
Who cares, who cares, who cares what stunt she has to pull
<span>C</span>         <span>G</span>         <span>D</span>             <span>G</span>     <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>    
She'll be remade as somebody original

<span>D</span>        <span>G</span>        <span>C</span>   <span>Em</span>
Somebody original
<span>D</span>        <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>   
Somebody original
<span>D</span>        <span>G</span>    
Somebody original
