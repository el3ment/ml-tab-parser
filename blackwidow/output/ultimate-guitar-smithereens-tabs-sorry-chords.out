<span>E</span> - <span>A</span> - <span>D</span> - <span>G</span> - <span>A</span> 

<span>E</span>
Things get better when we're apart
<span>E</span>
'Cause every time I'm with you girl, you break my heart
<span>A</span>                        <span>D</span>                  <span>E</span>
'Cause you don't look at things the same as me

<span>E</span>
You say stay and I say no
<span>E</span>
You make me wanna run when you say hello
<span>A</span>                     <span>D</span>      <span>E</span> 
'Cause you and I will always disagree


       <span>A</span>
I will stand up, I will fall
             <span>G</span>
Please don't wait for me to call
        <span>F#m</span>             <span>B</span>
I would like to say I'm sorry
         <span>E</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>D</span>   <span>G</span> <span>A</span> (x2)
But I won't


<span>E</span>
Words you whispered into my ear
<span>E</span>
Just make me wanna run, wanna disappear
<span>A</span>                      <span>D</span>                  <span>E</span>
'Cause I don't look at things the way you do

<span>E</span>
I'm not happy when you're around
<span>E</span>
You make me wanna run, fall and hit the ground
<span>A</span>                       <span>D</span>                <span>E</span>
And you're just not the girl that I once knew


         <span>A</span>
I would like to make your day
         <span>G</span>
But I'd rather fade away
        <span>F#m</span>             <span>B</span>
I would like to say I'm sorry
         <span>E</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>D</span>   <span>G</span> <span>A</span> (x2)
But I won't


Solo: repeat the verse chords (E - E - A - D - E)

        <span>A</span>
Now my back's against the wall
           <span>G</span> 
But I'm not afraid at all
        <span>F#m</span>             <span>B</span>
I would like to say I'm sorry
         <span>E</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>D</span>   <span>G</span> <span>A</span> (x2)
But I won't

<span>E</span>
Things get better when we're apart
<span>E</span>
And every time I'm with you, girl, you break my heart
<span>A</span>                      <span>D</span>                  <span>E</span>
'Cause I don't look at things the way you do

         <span>A</span>
You will not forgive my sins
         <span>G</span>
In this game where no one wins
        <span>F#m</span>             <span>B</span>
I would like to say I'm sorry
         <span>E</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>D</span>   <span>G</span> <span>A</span>
But I won't
         <span>A</span>
No, I'm never going to stay
        <span>G</span>
And I should be on my way
        <span>F#m</span>              <span>B</span>
I would love to say I'm sorry
         <span>E</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>D</span>   <span>G</span> <span>A</span>
But I won't

         <span>E</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>D</span>   <span>G</span> <span>A</span>
Say sorry, baby but I won't (baby, I won't)
         <span>E</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>D</span>   <span>G</span> <span>A</span>
Say sorry, baby but I won't (baby, I won't)
         <span>E</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>D</span>   <span>G</span> <span>A</span>
Say sorry, baby but I won't (baby, I won't)
         <span>E</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>D</span>   <span>G</span> <span>A</span>    <span>E</span>
Say sorry, baby but I won't
