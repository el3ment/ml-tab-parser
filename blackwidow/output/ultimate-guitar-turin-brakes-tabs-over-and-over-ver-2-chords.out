%%%% Tab:<i></i>Brillaint song, brillaint band, brillaint album. These guys are amazing, clever
and brillaint. As you can probebly tell i like Turin Brakes. This song is pretty
repetitive, i am a bit dogy about the 4th chord in the sequence but this is just
what i think it is. Please rate it good lol. If there's anything dogy then please
e-mail me: totallyph@hotmail.com (its msn so add me if you like). Enjoy!



Intro:

<span>B</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span> <span>Bb</span>

Verse

<span>B</span>           <span>G</span>
Life isn't always easy 
<span>D</span>        <span>Bb</span>
 This we know my friends
<span>B</span>              <span>G</span> 
 I thought you knew where to go
<span>D</span>                       <span>Bb</span>
 But you were following me 

             <span>B</span>
So lets get lost in space 
  <span>G</span>
I feel this place
<span>D</span>                         <span>Bb</span> 
 I'm stuck in the rat race 
        <span>B</span>            <span>G</span>
It's a lovely day to lose your way 
<span>D</span>                     <span>Bb</span>
 And get stuck in the loop..... 

Chorus:
<span>B</span>     <span>G</span>                <span>D</span>   <span>A</span>                       <span>B</span>
      Over and over again, you could never make it stop 
<span>G</span>                 <span>D</span>  <span>A</span>                         <span>B</span>
Over and over again, you could never make it stop
<span>G</span>                 <span>D</span>  <span>A</span>                         <span>B</span>
Over and over again, you could never make it stop
<span>G</span>                 <span>D</span>  <span>A</span>                         <span>B</span>
Over and over again, you could never make it stop

Break:

<span>B</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span> <span>Bb</span>  x2

    <span>B</span>        <span>G</span>
My old bones stroll along 
<span>D</span>             <span>Bb</span>
Railway track is oh so long 
<span>B</span>              <span>G</span>               
Stem the tide, the nine to five
<span>D</span>             <span>Bb</span> 
Slowly eating me alive 
<span>B</span>                   <span>G</span>
But all night long, carry on
<span>D</span>               <span>Bb</span>          <span>B</span>             <span>G</span>
We're stumbling slowly to a lovely day to lose your way 
<span>D</span>                     <span>Bb</span>
 And get stuck in the loop..... 

Chorus  x4
