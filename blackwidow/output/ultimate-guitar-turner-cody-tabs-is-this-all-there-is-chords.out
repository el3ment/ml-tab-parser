Is This All There Is?

<span>Em</span> <span>B</span> <span>C</span> <span>G</span>

<span>G</span>               <span>Em</span>               <span>Bm</span>             <span>G</span>      
I was alone and terrified by the midnight in my soul,
<span>G</span>                           <span>Em</span>                    <span>Am</span>           <span>D</span>
By the burning bush and the blushing bride on the night I lost control,
        <span>Bm</span>                                   <span>G</span>                   <span>D</span> 
I said, "mister, let me ask you (while these last few take their toll),
<span>G</span>                     <span>B</span>                     <span>C</span>                       <span>G</span>
Is this all there is, is this all there is, is this all there is to know?"

<span>Em</span> <span>B</span> <span>C</span> <span>G</span>

<span>G</span>                  <span>Em</span>               <span>Bm</span>               <span>G</span>
"I road out on the howling wind and slept out on the shore,
<span>G</span>                  <span>Em</span>              <span>Am</span>                  <span>D</span>      
I walked along the road of sin and knocked on heaven's door,
      <span>Bm</span>                          <span>G</span>            <span>D</span>
But I have no way of knowing what I am going toward,
<span>G</span>                     <span>B</span>                     <span>C</span>                       <span>G</span>
Is this all there is, is this all there is, is this all there my Lord?"

<span>G</span>                     <span>Em</span>           <span>Bm</span>               <span>G</span>
"I loved a fair young woman in the springtime of my year,
<span>G</span>                   <span>Em</span>           <span>Am</span>            <span>D</span>  
But that was all so long ago and far away from here,
<span>Bm</span>                                  <span>G</span>                <span>D</span>
And I recall the last thing was her asking through a tear,
<span>G</span>                     <span>B</span>                     <span>C</span>                       <span>G</span>
Is this all there is, is this all there is, is this all there is my dear?"

<span>Em</span> <span>B</span> <span>C</span> <span>G</span>

<span>G</span>                    <span>Em</span>          <span>Bm</span>               <span>G</span>
"When Noah walked on dry land he drank his fill of wine,
<span>G</span>            <span>Em</span>                    <span>Am</span>               <span>D</span>  
It gave him blood shot eyes and it strangled up his mind,
<span>Bm</span>                                 <span>G</span>            <span>D</span>
How could that thing happen to the father of mankind?
<span>G</span>                     <span>B</span>                     <span>C</span>                       <span>G</span>
Is this all there is, is this all there is, is this all there is to find?"

<span>Em</span> <span>B</span> <span>C</span> <span>G</span>

<span>G</span>                 <span>Em</span>                <span>Bm</span>            <span>G</span>
So I cried out my question, but the lesson was to be,
<span>G</span>                   <span>Em</span>             <span>Am</span>            <span>D</span>  
For him to give his blessing as we parted company,
        <span>Bm</span>                          <span>G</span>            <span>D</span>
And for late into the evening me to sing this melody,
<span>G</span>                     <span>B</span>                     <span>C</span>                       <span>G</span>
Is this all there is, is this all there is, is this all there is for me?

<span>Em</span> <span>B</span> <span>C</span> <span>G</span>
