<span>Csus2</span>
I'm not scared to tell the truth
                   <span>G</span>
I've been to hell and back, and I went with you
    <span>Csus2</span>
Remind me what we were before
               <span>D</span>
When we said you are mine and I am yours

  <span>Csus2</span>
I don't know much, but I know myself
         <span>G</span>
And I don't want to love anybody else
            <span>Csus2</span>
So let's break the spell and lift the curse
                                <span>D</span>
Remember when we fell for each other head first

Chorus:

                   <span>G</span>
Look at this heart shaped wreckage
<span>D</span>
What have we done?
                <span>Csus2</span>                    <span>Csus2</span>
We've got scars from battles nobody won
                    <span>G</span>
We can start over, better
<span>D</span>                                       <span>Csus2</span>
Both of us know if we just let the broken pieces
<span>Csus2</span>
Let the broken pieces go

<span>Csus2</span>
I can't find you in the dark
      <span>G</span>
Will we get back to who we are?
         <span>Csus2</span>
And I can't fix this on my own
                         <span>D</span>
Our love is still the best thing I've ever known

                   <span>G</span>
Look at this heart shaped wreckage
<span>D</span>
What have we done?
                <span>Csus2</span>                    <span>Csus2</span>
We've got scars from battles nobody won
                    <span>G</span>
We can start over, better
<span>D</span>                                       <span>Csus2</span>
Both of us know if we just let the broken pieces
<span>Csus2</span>                         <span>G</span>
Let the broken pieces go
<span>D</span>                                 <span>Csus2</span>
Let the broken pieces go
       <span>Csus2</span>                            <span>G</span>        <span>D</span>      <span>Csus2</span>
Just hold on to each other tonight, oh


                   <span>G</span>
Look at this heart shaped wreckage
<span>D</span>
What have we done?
                <span>Csus2</span>                    <span>Csus2</span>
We've got scars from battles nobody won
                    <span>G</span>
We can start over, better
<span>D</span>                                       <span>Csus2</span>
Both of us know if we just let the broken pieces
<span>Csus2</span>
Let the broken pieces
<span>Csus2</span> 
Let the broken pieces
<span>Csus2</span>
Let the broken pieces...
