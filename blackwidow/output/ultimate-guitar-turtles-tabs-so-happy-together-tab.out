Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love and hold her tight
So happy together


Verse: F#m E D C#7

Chorus: F# E F# A


            F#m
If I should call you up, invest a dime
                  E
And you say you belong to me and ease my mind
                D
Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
           C#7
So happy together

F#             E                 F#
I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
           A
For all my life
F#                   E                    F#
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue
           A
For all my life

Verse
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

Chorus
I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue
For all my life

Verse
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

Chorus
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba

Verse
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

(just keep playing F# and E)
So happy together
How is the weather
So happy together
We're happy together
So happy together
Happy together
So happy together
So happy together (ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba)

TADA!!!
