%%%% comments:[u'<p class="mtop5">Chord voicings are correct, but are actually played differently.

%%%% Tab:<i></i>This is the definative song of the album i think, and it's one of my favourite
songs ever written. (Also, despite critical statements about the Ether Song
album, it's great, and perfect for those seeking acoustic bliss.)

Intro
=====
Here they are just playing through the verse chords, first plucking the 5th
string note, and then strumming the rest of the strings after. (N.B. When they
reach the C they strum the rest of the strings subsequent times.)

The chords are:
<span>Emin</span> - <span>D</span> - <span>C</span> - <span>B</span>

Then they launch into the verse:
(N.B. when strumming the chords highlight the top 3 strings to get the same
effect on the song.)

Verse
===== 
<span>Emin</span>          <span>D</span>        <span>C</span>                     <span>B</span>  
If this gets ugly, I swear, this ain't our last chance.
<span>Emin</span>                <span>D</span>          <span>C</span>              <span>B</span>
The vultures that circle, my head, are flying alongside.
<span>Emin</span>   <span>D</span>    <span>C</span>    <span>B</span>
The world's turning...

Chorus
======
<span>E</span>       <span>Bmin</span>         <span>A</span>
I let somebody get under my skin.
<span>E</span>                <span>Bmin</span>     <span>A</span>
Long distance, losing is all that i'd seen.
<span>E</span>             <span>Bmin</span>  <span>A</span>
Now there's a river.
<span>E</span>             <span>Bmin</span>  <span>A</span>
Now there's a river.

Verse
=====
<span>Emin</span>         <span>D</span>                      <span>C</span>
Nothing can save me, my resolve betrayed me,
              <span>B</span>
Here come the hurricanes,
<span>Emin</span>              <span>D</span>                     <span>C</span>
I'm burning to get there, the middle of nowhere,
                  <span>B</span>
Storm warnings flicker while,
<span>Emin</span>  <span>D</span>     <span>C</span>    <span>B</span>
The world's turning.

Chorus
======
<span>E</span>       <span>Bmin</span>         <span>A</span>
I let somebody get under my skin.
<span>E</span>                <span>Bmin</span>     <span>A</span>
Long distance, losing is all that i'd seen.
<span>E</span>             <span>Bmin</span>  <span>A</span>
Now there's a river.
<span>E</span>             <span>Bmin</span>  <span>A</span>
Now there's a river.

After chorus keep strumming the chorus chords...
