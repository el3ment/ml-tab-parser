Imagine me and you - I do
                  <span>D</span>
I think about you day and night, it`s only right
                   <span>C</span>
to think about the girl I love and hold her tight
           <span>B7</span>
so Happy together
     
If I could call you up, invest a dime
and you say you belong to me, to ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be so very fine
-so happy together

when you`re with me, baby, the skies will be blue
           <span>G</span>
for all my life


Me and you and you and me
no matter how they toss the dice it had to be
the only one for me is you and you for me
- so happy together
