%%%% Tab:<i></i>TURIN BRAKES - Moonlight Mile (Rolling Stones Cover)
From the 'Late Night Tales' selection
Tabbed by Keir Alexander


OPEN G TUNING:   D G D G B D

[Intro and Verse]
-played over the chord of G
this is the main guitar sequence and is played throughout the song during the verses.
As the song progresses the theme changes subtly, you can improvise in the same style
at these parts and it sounds good.

its played in a loose bluesy style, that's different to the stones version, the 0's are 
show that you play two stings at the same time, the string with the number and the 
below it.

(intro)  Ollie sings along the sequence which is played twice

(verse)
When the wind blows and the rain feels cold
With a head full of snow
With a head full of snow
In the window there's a face you know
Don't the nights pass slow
Don't the nights pass slow

(chorus)
C                              G
The sound of strangers sending nothing to my mind
D                   C           G
Just another mad mad day on the road
I am just living to be lying by your side
But I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road
(verse)
Made a rag pile of my shiny clothes
Gonna warm my bones
Gonna warm my bones
I got silence on my radio
Let the air waves flow
Let the air waves flow

(chorus)
Oh I'm sleeping under strange strange skies
Just another mad mad day on the road
My dreams is fading down the railway line
I'm just about a moonlight mile down the road

(interlude)
improvise along the same sequence

C            G
yeah so come on
     D           C                          G
I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road


[Repeat sequence to end]


This is a great version of a great song, its quite different from the Stones' version, 
are tabs for that version (in standard tuning) but after listening to the Turin Brakes 
I was sure that it was played in an open G tuning. Its worth trying even if you aren't
used to playing in a different tuning.
