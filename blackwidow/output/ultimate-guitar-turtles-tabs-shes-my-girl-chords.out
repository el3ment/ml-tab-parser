<span>Em</span>
Mornin, mornin glory,
                                <span>F</span>
If you'd like to know where was I last night
      <span>Em</span>
Well, I saw a girl with a boy in her eye,
                    <span>F</span>
and she's so out of sight

      <span>F</span>
She's my girl,
                            <span>Bb</span>
and that's where I was last night:
         <span>E</span>     <span>E7</span> 
off in a dream!

      <span>E</span>
She's my girl,
                     <span>C/B</span>
I took her away last night:
<span>C</span>
went for a ride!
<span>Bm</span>                           <span>A</span>          <span>E</span>
Off in the sky, that's where I was last night.

<span>Em</span>

  <span>Em</span>
I just come back to tell ya,
           
there's a little bit of heaven,
               <span>F</span>
underneath the apple tree
    <span>Em</span>
And every time I see you with that smile on your face,
                               <span>F</span>
there's a little bit there for me

      <span>F</span>
She's my girl,
                            <span>Bb</span>
and that's where I was last night:
           <span>E</span>   <span>E7</span>
went for a ride!

      <span>E</span>
She's my girl,
                     <span>C/B</span>
I took her away last night:
<span>C</span>
went for a ride!

      <span>E</span>
She's my girl,
                            <span>C/B</span>
and that's where I was last night:
<span>C</span>
Gettin' so high!

      <span>E</span>
She's my girl,
                     <span>C/B</span>
I took her away last night:
<span>C</span>
off in the sky!

      <span>E</span>
She's my girl,
                            <span>C/B</span>
and that's where I was last night:
<span>C</span>
Gettin' so high!

<span>Bm</span>                           <span>A</span>          <span>E</span>
Off in the sky, that's where I was last night.

      <span>E</span>
She's my girl,
                     <span>C/B</span>
I took her away last night:

                     <span>C/B</span>
I took her away last night:
<span>C</span>
off in the sky!
