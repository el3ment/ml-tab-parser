The Eve of Destruction chords
The Turtles 1965 (P.F. Sloan)

<span>D</span> 

    <span>D</span>             <span>G</span>       <span>A</span>
The Eastern world it is explodin'
<span>D</span>                    <span>G</span>       <span>A</span>
Violence flarin' and bullets loadin'
       <span>D</span>                       <span>G</span>       <span>A</span>
You're old enough to kill, but not for votin'
    <span>D</span>                         <span>G</span>                      <span>A</span>
You don't believe in war, but what's that gun you're toting?
    <span>D</span>                         <span>G</span>      <span>A</span>
And even the Jordan River has bodies floatin'

        <span>D</span>        <span>G</span>        <span>A</span>        <span>D</span>             <span>Bm</span>
But you tell me, over and over and over again my friend,
        <span>G</span>                   <span>A</span>               <span>D</span>        <span>G</span> <span>A</span>
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

<span>D</span>                             <span>G</span>         <span>A</span>
Don't you understand what I'm tryin' to say  
<span>D</span>                                 <span>G</span>         <span>A</span>
Can't you feel the fears that I'm feelin' today
       <span>D</span>                        <span>G</span>           <span>A</span>
If the button is pushed there's no running away
            <span>D</span>                       <span>G</span>          <span>A</span>
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave
       <span>D</span>                         <span>G</span>                  <span>A</span>
Take a look around you boy, it's bound to scare you boy

        <span>D</span>        <span>G</span>        <span>A</span>        <span>D</span>             <span>Bm</span>
But you tell me, over and over and over again my friend,
        <span>G</span>                   <span>A</span>               <span>D</span>        <span>G</span> <span>A</span>
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

        <span>D</span>        <span>G</span>        <span>A</span>        <span>D</span>             <span>Bm</span>
But you tell me, over and over and over again my friend,
        <span>G</span>                   <span>A</span>               <span>D</span>        <span>G</span> <span>A</span>
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

<span>D</span>                           <span>G</span>         <span>A</span>
Think of all the hate there is in Red China
<span>D</span>                          <span>G</span>         <span>A</span>
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama
<span>D</span>                       <span>G</span>           <span>A</span>
You may leave here for four days in space
<span>D</span>                             <span>G</span>        <span>A</span>
But when you return, it's the same old place
    <span>D</span>                   <span>G</span>            <span>A</span>
The pounding drums, the pride and disgrace
        <span>D</span>                   <span>G</span>             <span>A</span>
You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace
          <span>D</span>                        
Hate your next door neighbor
    <span>G</span>               <span>A</span>
But don't forget to say grace

    <span>D</span>        <span>G</span>        <span>A</span>        <span>D</span>             <span>Bm</span>
And tell me, over and over and over again my friend,
        <span>G</span>                   <span>A</span>               <span>D</span>        
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.
        <span>G</span>                   <span>A</span>               <span>D</span>         <span>G</span> <span>A</span>   <span>D</span>
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction
