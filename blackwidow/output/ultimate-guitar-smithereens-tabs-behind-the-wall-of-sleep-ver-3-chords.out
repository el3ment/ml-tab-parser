Capo 4

Intro: <span>A</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>Bm</span> / <span>A</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>Bm</span>

<span>A</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>Bm</span>                                  <span>D</span>  
She had hair like Jeannie Shrimpton back in 1965
        <span>Em</span>                           <span>Bm</span>  
She had legs that never ended, I was halfway paralyzed
<span>A</span>   <span>A</span>   <span>Bm</span>                               <span>D</span>
She was tall and cool and pretty and she dressed as black as coal
       <span>Em</span>                              <span>Bm</span>
If she asked me to I'd murder, I would gladly lose my soul

      <span>D</span>              <span>Bm</span>                <span>D</span>            <span>Bm</span>           
Now I lie in bed and think of her, Sometimes I even weep
       <span>G</span>              <span>A</span>              <span>Bm</span>
Then I dream of her behind a wall of sleep

<span>A</span>    <span>A</span>   <span>Bm</span>                             <span>D</span>
Well she held a bass guitar and she was playing in a band
        <span>Em</span>                                <span>Bm</span>
And she stood just like Bill Wyman, now I am her biggest fan
<span>A</span>   <span>A</span> <span>Bm</span>                             <span>D</span>                         
Now I know I'm one of many who would like to be your friend 
         <span>Em</span>                           <span>Bm</span> 
And I've got to find a way to let you know I'm not like them

      <span>D</span>              <span>Bm</span>                <span>D</span>            <span>Bm</span>           
Now I lie in bed and think of her, Sometimes I even weep
       <span>G</span>              <span>A</span>              <span>Bm</span>
Then I dream of her behind a wall of sleep

Now I lie in bed and think of her, Sometimes I even weep

<span>A</span>    <span>A</span>   <span>Bm</span>                               <span>D</span>
Got your number from a friend of mine who lives in your home town
           <span>Em</span>                               <span>Bm</span>  
Called you up to have a drink your roommate said you weren't around
<span>A</span>   <span>A</span> <span>Bm</span>                             <span>D</span>
Now I know I'm one of many who would like to be your friend 
         <span>Em</span>                           <span>Bm</span>
And I've got to find a way to let you know I'm not like them

       <span>G</span>              <span>A</span>              <span>Bm</span>
Then I dream of her behind a wall of sleep
  <span>G</span>      <span>A</span>       <span>Bm</span> 
Behind a wall of sleep
  <span>G</span>      <span>A</span>       <span>Bm</span>
Behind a wall of sleep
  <span>G</span>      <span>A</span>       <span>Bm</span>      
Behind a wall of sleep
