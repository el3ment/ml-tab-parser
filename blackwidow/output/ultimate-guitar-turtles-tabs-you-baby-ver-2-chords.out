%%%% title:You Baby (ver 2) Chords %%%%
%%%% comments:[u'<p class="mtop5">An Am sounds better at " feel like smiling " rather than a G; and add a C chord at " weary " day is through.   Same chord changes at " wildest dreams " , and " craziest schemes ". <br><br>Add a C chord at " A little bit" and a G Chord at " soul ".  <br><br>Play a G chord at " Add a touch of magic" and play an Am chord at "greatest " , a Bm chord at " thing " , a C chord at " rock n, and a D chord at " roll "</p>'] %%%%

         <span>G</span>            <span>D</span>
From the time I fall asleep
        <span>C</span>               <span>D</span>        
Til the morning comes I dream about
<span>G</span>   <span>D</span>  <span>C</span> <span>D</span>
You baby
      <span>G</span>        <span>D</span>

You baby
<span>Bm</span>               <span>C</span>
And who makes me feel like smiling
                      <span>D</span>
When the weary day is through

<span>G</span>   <span>C</span>     <span>D</span>  <span>C</span>       <span>G</span>    <span>C</span>     <span>D</span>          <span>G</span>

         <span>G</span>        <span>D</span>
They say candy is sweet

But it just can t compete with
<span>G</span>   <span>D</span>  <span>C</span> <span>D</span>

You baby, no-one but you, baby, nobody but you 2X

  <span>G</span>                      <span>C</span>
A little ray of sunshine
                <span>G</span>
A little bit of soul

Add just a touch of magic
            <span>C</span>        <span>Am</span>          <span>D</span>
You got the greatest thing since rock n roll

<span>G</span>   <span>C</span>     <span>D</span>  <span>C</span>       <span>G</span>    <span>C</span>     <span>D</span>          <span>G</span>
