Must point out that the A and G chords in the verse are barre chords, as it\'s neccesary to get the strumming pattern right.</p>', u'<p class="mtop5">Wow, I still remember this song, my first post on this site!<br>My mail has changed now, is alexem82@gmail.com<br><br>Enjoy!</p>'] %%%%

(A x 2 G x 2) x 6


<span>A</span>                      <span>G</span>
Batten up the hatches, here comes the cold
<span>A</span>                            <span>G</span>
I can feel it creeping, it's making me old
<span>A</span>                                <span>G</span>
You give me so much love that it blows my brains out
A x 2 G x 2
<span>A</span>                                  <span>G</span>
You need something better than the bacon and eggs
<span>A</span>                                 <span>G</span>
The creaking in the walls and the banging in the bed
<span>A</span>                                <span>G</span>
You give me so much love that it blows my brains out
A x 2 D x 2

Chorus
<span>E</span>       <span>C#m</span>  <span>D</span>                  <span>Dsus2</span>   <span>E</span> 
 Summer rain,dripping down your face again
        <span>C#m</span>  <span>D</span>               <span>Dsus2</span>      <span>E</span>
 Summer rain,praying someone feels the same
          <span>C#m</span>          <span>D</span>             <span>Dsus2</span>
 Take the pain killer, cycle on your bicycle
<span>E</span>              <span>C#m</span>  <span>Dsus2</span> <span>D</span>
Leave all this misery behind

(A x 2 G x 2) x 4


My love giving me head, feeling very guilty,breaking the bread
Losing my attention, taking the world on
So batten up the hatches, here comes the cold
I can feel it creeping, it's making me old
You give me so much love that it blows my brains out

Chorus

A x 2  G x 2
My love x 4

Chorus x 2

Leave all this misery behind
Leave all this misery behind
Leave all this misery behind.
