VERSE
This is the last chance The last chance to heed the call
This is the moment The moment awaits us all
You've got so many questions
Buzzing around your brain yeah

This is the last time The last time you see my face
This is the moment The last chance to leave this place
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
I'm drowning inside the ground

CHORUS
Don't ask too many questions (x4)
Too many questions

VERSE
This is the feeling The colour you can't describe
This is the shape it makes now
It's very revealing You crash a plane into my life
The deafening silent sound

CHORUS
Don't ask too many questions (x4)
Too many questions of me...
