<span>G</span>
Cub scouts are screaming
<span>C</span>
Needing ice creaming and
<span>D/B</span>                       <span>D</span>
Oh the pleasures of June

I'm in a parked car
Flowers Seem friendly and
People in hallways feel walls

Now It is night time
Maybe were cruising avoiding
The anti-cruise

<span>G</span>
I don't really know
<span>C</span>
where
<span>D/B</span>          <span>D</span>
we       are

             <span>Am</span>
If thing get real
           <span>C</span>                 <span>G</span>   <span>D</span>
Promise to take me Somewhere else
       <span>Am</span>
By the time
              <span>C</span>
Fear takes me over
                 <span>G</span>      <span>D</span>
Will we still be rolling
              <span>G</span>
Feeling oblivion

<span>G</span> <span>C</span> <span>D/B</span> <span>D</span>
<span>G</span> <span>C</span> <span>D/B</span> <span>B</span>

Once in a while now
The Lionaid laugher can
Burn through the hole in my ears

Like a man with glasses
Catching a sunbeam and
Burning the skin of a kid

Hyper little fragments
Disturbing the fragments
Of all might fear

While I just go into the water

             <span>Am</span>
If thing get real
           <span>C</span>                 <span>G</span>   <span>D</span>
Promise to take me somewhere else
       <span>Am</span>
By the time
              <span>C</span>
Fear takes me over
                 <span>G</span>      <span>D</span>
Will we still be rolling?
              <span>G</span>
Feeling oblivion

<span>G</span> <span>C</span> <span>D/B</span> <span>D</span>
<span>G</span> <span>C</span> <span>D/B</span> <span>B</span>

So don't leave me
Here on my own

So don't leave us
Here on our own

<span>Am</span>
If thing get real
           <span>C</span>                 <span>G</span>   <span>D</span>
Promise to take me somewhere else
       <span>Am</span>
By the time
              <span>C</span>
Fear takes me over
                 <span>G</span>      <span>D</span>
Will we still be rolling?
              <span>G</span>
Feeling oblivion


NB The lyrics are wrong in places but I can't tell what he is singing.
Please send any corrections or suggestions.  The chords after the
chorus are wrong too but they fit.  I have performed it many times
but there are subtle differences in the album version.
