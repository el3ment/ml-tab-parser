Behind the Wall of Sleep

by Smithereens


             <span>D</span>
She had hair like Jeannie Shipton back

<span>F</span>
in 1965, She had

<span>C</span>
legs the never ended, I was

<span>D</span>
halfway paralyzed


              <span>D</span>
She was tall and cool and pretty and she

<span>F</span>
dressed as black as coal, If she'd

<span>C</span>
ask me to I'd murder, I would

<span>D</span>
gladly lose my soul


CHORUS:

<span>F</span>		                  <span>D</span>
Now i lie in bed and think of her

<span>F</span>		               <span>D</span>
sometimes i even weep, then I

<span>Bb</span>
dream of her, be-

<span>C</span>		               <span>D</span>
-hind the wall of sleep

Well she held a bass guitar and she was

playing in a band and she

stood just like Bill Wyman, now I

am her biggest fan


Now I know I'm one of many who would

like to be your friend and I've

got to find a way to let you

know I'm not like them


CHORUS:

<span>F</span>		                  <span>D</span>
Now i lie in bed and think of her

<span>F</span>		              <span>D</span>
sometimes i even weep, then I

<span>Bb</span>
dream of her, be-

<span>C</span>		               <span>D</span>
-hind the wall of sleep



Got your number from a friend of mine

who lives in your hometown, called you

up to have a drink, your roomate

said you weren't around


Now I know i'm one of many who would

like to be your friend and I've

got to find a way to let you

know I'm not like them


CHORUS:

<span>F</span>		                  <span>D</span>
Now i lie in bed and think of her

<span>F</span>		               <span>D</span>
sometimes i even weep, then I

<span>Bb</span>
dream of her, be-

<span>C</span>		               <span>D</span>
-hind the wall of sleep


behind the wall of sleep

behind the wall of sleep

behind the wall of sleep</jonathanschoning>
