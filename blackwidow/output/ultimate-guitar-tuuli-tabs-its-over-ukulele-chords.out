Intro: Strike E5 once then mute for rest of intro and into chorus

<span>E5</span>          <span>B5</span>               CM5           <span>A5</span>
You never told me from the first time
I had to beg you not to leave
You never seemed to care the first time
Now it's the last time you are walking out on me

<span>E5</span>           <span>B5</span>               <span>CM7</span>
You've done enough to me to hate you
<span>A5</span>                <span>E5</span>
Expecting me to forgive you
  <span>B5</span>                    <span>CM7</span>        <span>A5</span>
I don't believe you'll change


[Bridge]
<span>E5</span>                   <span>B5</span>
I don't know where I went wrong
<span>CM7</span>                <span>A5</span>
You only want me when I'm gone
<span>CM7</span>                        <span>A5</span>
You're not that smart,and not so strong
      <span>E5</span>          <span>B5</span>
You only want me when I'm gone

[Chorus]
<span>E5</span>          <span>B5</span>       <span>CM7</span>
It's over, all over, so over
<span>A5</span>
You'll never know
<span>E5</span>            <span>B5</span>               <span>CM7</span>           <span>A5</span>
What does it take to make you believe
<span>E5</span>          <span>B5</span>
How did we ever start
<span>CM7</span>            <span>A5</span> 
You deserve a broken heart (1)
I don't deserve this broken heart (2)
You dont't deserve my broken heart (3)
<span>CM7</span>       <span>B5</span>               <span>E5</span>
Cry me a river we're so through


People chage and I forget you
I know that time heals all wounds
But momories don't fade
I feel so stupid when I look back
All the things that you lack
Reflected onto me 

[Bridge]

You never told me from the first time
I had to beg you not to leave
You never seemed to care the first time 
Now it's the last toime you are walking out on me
