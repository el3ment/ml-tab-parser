Love Minus Zero chords
The Turtles 1965 (Bob Dylan)

<span>C</span> <span>Csus2</span> <span>C</span> <span>Csus4</span> 2x

   <span>C</span>                            <span>F</span> 
My love she speaks like silence,
                  <span>C</span>        <span>F</span>
Without ideals or violence,
                              <span>C</span>
She doesn't have to say she's faithful,
          <span>Dm</span>         <span>F</span>         <span>G</span>    <span>Gsus4</span>
Yet she's true, like ice, like fire.

<span>C</span>                  <span>F</span>
People carry roses,
                         <span>C</span>     <span>F</span>
And make promises by the hours,
                            <span>C</span>
My love she laughs like the flowers,
<span>Dm</span>   <span>G</span>           <span>C</span>       <span>C</span> <span>Csus2</span> <span>C</span> <span>Csus4</span>
Valentines can't buy her.

    <span>C</span>                          <span>F</span> 
The bridge at midnight trembles, 
                   <span>C</span>       <span>F</span> 
The country doctor rambles,
                        <span>C</span>
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
          <span>Dm</span>                 <span>F</span>        <span>G</span>     <span>Gsus4</span>
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.

    <span>C</span>                        <span>F</span> 
The wind howls like a hammer,
                         <span>C</span>    <span>F</span> 
The night blows cold and rainy,
                        <span>C</span>
My love she's like some raven
      <span>Dm</span>          <span>G</span>        <span>C</span>    <span>Csus4</span>
At my window with a broken wing.

<span>Dm</span> <span>G</span> <span>C</span> <span>Csus4</span> <span>C</span> <span>Csus4</span> 2x

       <span>C</span>                            <span>F</span>
In the dime stores and bus stations,
                   <span>C</span>      <span>F</span>
People talk of situations,
                      <span>C</span>
Read books, repeat quotations,
         <span>Dm</span>      <span>F</span>      <span>G</span>    <span>Gsus4</span>
Draw conclusions on the wall.

<span>C</span>                        <span>F</span>
Some speak of the future,
                   <span>C</span>      <span>F</span>
My love she speaks softly,
                                  
                                  <span>C</span>
She knows there's no success like failure
         <span>Dm</span>        <span>G</span>             <span>C</span>   <span>Csus4</span>
And that failure's no success at all.

<span>Dm</span>   <span>F</span>    <span>C</span>
Ahhh ahhh ahhh

<span>Dm</span>   <span>F</span>    <span>G</span>
Ahhh ahhh ahhh

<span>C</span>  <span>Csus4</span> <span>C</span> . . .
