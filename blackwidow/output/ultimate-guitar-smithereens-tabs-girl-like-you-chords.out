(<span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>G</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>D</span>,  <span>F</span> <span>E</span> over verse)
I used to travel in the shadows
And I never found the nerve to try to walk up to you
But now I am a man and I know that there's no time to waste
There's too much to lose
Girl you say anything at all, and you know that you can call
And I'll be right there for you
First love, heartbreak, tough luck, big mistake
What else can you do?

<span>G</span>                     <span>A</span>
I'll say anything you want to hear
<span>G</span>           <span>D</span>           <span>A</span>
I'll see everything through
<span>G</span>                 <span>A</span>
I'll do anything I have to do
<span>D</span>               <span>G</span>                   <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>G</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>D</span>,  <span>F</span> <span>E</span> 
Just to win the love of a girl like you, 
<span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>G</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>D</span>,  <span>F</span> <span>E</span>
 a girl like you

(<span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>G</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>D</span>,  <span>F</span> <span>E</span> over verse)
People talk and people stare, tell them I don't really care
This is the place I should be
And if they think it's really strange for a girl like you
To be in love with someone like me
I wanna tell them all to go to hell
That we're doing very well without them you see
That's just the way it is and they will see
I am yours and you are mine the way it should be

<span>G</span>                    <span>A</span>
I'll say anything you want to hear
<span>G</span>             <span>D</span>       <span>A</span>
I'll see everything through
<span>G</span>                  <span>A</span>
I'll do anything I have to do
<span>D</span>               <span>G</span>                  <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>G</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>D</span>,  <span>F</span> <span>E</span> 
Just to win the love of a girl like you, 
(<span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>G</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>D</span>,  <span>F</span> <span>E</span>)  over each “girl like you”
a girl like you, a girl like you, a girl like you, oh yeah!

Yeah! Then (<span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>G</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>D</span>,  <span>F</span> <span>E</span>) clean twice

SOLO over <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>G</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>D</span>,  <span>F</span> <span>E</span> (4 times) then
<span>G</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>G</span>, <span>D</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>G</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>D</span>, <span>G</span>(this is the Chorus part)

<span>A</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>G</span>,<span>A</span>   <span>A</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>G</span>,<span>A</span>  <span>G</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>G</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>G</span>,<span>A</span>    
<span>A</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>G</span>,<span>A</span>  <span>G</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>A</span>,<span>G</span>  twice over next 4 lines
Now if I seem a little wild, there's no holding back
I'm trying to get a message to you
I won't take anything from anyone
I won't walk and I won't run, I believe in you

*(No guitar or bass over next line London line) bass fill at end
London, Washington, anywhere you are I'll run
Together we'll be  Start A, A, A, G, A, D,  F E with next line and remaining verse
Inside, outside, got my pride
I won't let him take you from me

<span>G</span>                      <span>A</span>
I'll say anything you want to hear
<span>G</span>             <span>D</span>         <span>A</span>
I'll see everything through
<span>G</span>                    <span>A</span>
I'll do anything I have to do
<span>D</span>                <span>G</span>        <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>G</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>D</span>,  <span>F</span> <span>E</span> on each “girl like you”
Just to win the love of a girl like you, a girl like you, a girl like you, a girl 
like you, a girl like you, a girl like you, oh yeah

(<span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>G</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>D</span>,  <span>F</span> <span>E</span> over this)
I'll say anything (I'll say anything)
I'll take anything (I'll take anything)
I'll say anything, almost anything except goodbye (start soloing over the rest of song)

(<span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>G</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>D</span>,  <span>F</span> <span>E</span> over this)
I'll say anything (I'll say anything)
I'll take anything (I'll take anything)
I'll say anything, almost anything except goodbye







Solo not perfect but may lead you in the right direction
