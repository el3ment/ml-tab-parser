%%%% Tab:<i></i>intro: <span>Bm</span> <span>G</span> <span>A</span> (x2)

<span>Bm</span>                     <span>A</span>                        <span>Bm</span>           <span>A</span>   
There's a block on the edge of this town no one talks about
<span>Bm</span>                       <span>A</span>                         <span>Bm</span>             <span>A</span>   
Where the train doesn't stop and the kids know they're not getting out
          <span>Em</span>                  <span>C</span>  
You live in the loop, the smokes on the stoop
<span>Bm</span>                    <span>G</span>
Counting the coins you got
      <span>Em</span>                <span>Bm</span>                  <span>G</span>
You work at a bar where all that you are is everything you're not 


<span>D</span>
Someone tell me when
<span>A</span>
I can start again
<span>Em</span>              <span>G</span>
And rewrite this story 
<span>D</span>
How long can I stay
<span>A</span>                     <span>Em</span>  
Lost without a way to rewrite
               <span>G</span>    
I wish I could rewrite this story 

<span>Bm</span> <span>G</span> <span>A</span> (x2)

<span>Em</span>                  <span>D</span>                         <span>Em</span>            <span>D</span>   
Pretty face, pretty voice; pretty much someone they forget
<span>Em</span>               <span>D</span>                      <span>Em</span>                  <span>D</span> 
Hard to tell me apart from the ten other girls they just met
    <span>Am</span>                     <span>F</span>
"We can't see the hook, we can't sell the look"
<span>Em</span>              <span>G</span> 
I hear it every day
     <span>Am</span>                 <span>Em</span>
"You won't be a star if you're who you are"
<span>C</span>
So I just fade away 


<span>G</span>
Make me someone new
<span>D</span>                    <span>Am</span>           <span>C</span> 
Tell me what I do to rewrite this story 
<span>G</span>
How long can I stay
<span>D</span>                     <span>Am</span>  
Lost without a way to rewrite
               <span>C</span>             <span>D</span>
I wish I could rewrite this story 

             <span>C</span>
Change every word of every line
<span>D</span>                   <span>C</span> 
Write any story but mine 

<span>G</span> 
Someone tell me when
<span>D</span>                     <span>Am</span>           <span>C</span>
Can I start again and rewrite this story 

Yeah, Yeah...
<span>G</span>
How long can I stay
<span>D</span>                     <span>Am</span>
Lost without a way to rewrite
<span>C</span>
Rewrite
               <span>Am</span>           <span>C</span>
I wish I could rewrite this story
