So future boy where are you from
                                     <span>D7</span>
My time machine crashed over yonder.
                              <span>G</span>
Syphillis is a bitch but contracting hiv is much worse.
<span>D</span>
Why are you pushing info into me,
                        <span>D7</span>            <span>G</span>
I have no need for it, I?m from the stars.
   <span>D</span>
I thought you?d like to know your scoop
                                    <span>D7</span>
I?m taking babies back with me, yeah.
                                   <span>G</span>
I?m taking them back home so they can see
There?s a much better place.
   <span>D</span>
I?ve got a sister with an open mind
                           <span>D7</span>                           <span>G</span>
And my friends are all junkies but there still my friends,
   <span>D</span>
As long as they don?t use monkeys,
                        <span>D7</span>                          <span>G</span>
We enjoy the heat of stolen days in the summer of 93.
               <span>D</span>
Well the future boy said I?ve got friends but you know sometimes
                      <span>D7</span>                            <span>G</span>
It all depends on how tall they are against yourself.
<span>D</span>                                             <span>D7</span>                     <span>G</span>
I am the future boy, I am the future boy, I am the future boy, I am the future boy   X 2

<span>D</span>
My friends have all gone and left me so I decided
                  <span>D7</span>                 <span>G</span>
To come hear and see myself as a baby,
  <span>D</span>                                                                   <span>D7</span>
But it looks like I?m stuck hear this time, oh shit,
                      <span>G</span>
I?m gonna miss my friends.
<span>D</span>
No your still the future boy, yes I?m still the future boy
 <span>D7</span>                                                    <span>G</span>
We?ll build you a time machine to get back home.

<span>D</span>                                                                             <span>D7</span>                           
           <span>G</span>
Still the future boy, well I?m still the future boy,  still the future boy, well im still the future boy X2.
