<span>F</span> <span>C</span> <span>Dm</span> <span>Bb</span> <span>C</span>

[CHORUS] x2
<span>F</span>              <span>C</span>            <span>Dm</span>  
We want to see Jesus lifted high,  
              <span>Bb</span>    <span>C</span>           <span>F</span>  
A banner that flies across the land,  
                    <span>C</span>                <span>Dm</span>  
That all men might see the truth and know,  
          <span>Bb</span>     <span>C</span> 
He is the way to heaven.
  
[VERSE]  
<span>F</span>               <span>C</span>               <span>Dm</span>             <span>Bb</span>      <span>C</span>      <span>F</span>  
  We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high.  
<span>F</span>               <span>C</span>               <span>Dm</span>             <span>Bb</span>      <span>C</span>      <span>F</span>  
  We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high.  

<span>F</span>       <span>C</span>                 <span>Dm</span>  
Step by step we're moving forward,  
          <span>C</span>             <span>F</span>
Little by little taking ground,  
      <span>C</span>                    <span>Dm</span>
Every prayer is a powerful weapon,  
            <span>Bb</span>                <span>C</span>
Strongholds all come tumbling down  
And down and down and down......
