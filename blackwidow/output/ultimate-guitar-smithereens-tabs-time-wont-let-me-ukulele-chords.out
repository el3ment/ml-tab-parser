Subject: Time_wont_let_me.crd * Correction*

Recently, I submitted lyrics and chord for the Smitherines song "Time wont
let me", and later discovered an error in the chords (Some minor chords were
incorrectly shown as major). I wish to submit the following corrected
version,  and apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused to
anyone.

<span>G</span>	<span>Em</span>	<span>F</span>	<span>D</span>

<span>G</span>		<span>F</span>		<span>G</span>

<span>G</span>		<span>F</span>		<span>G</span>
