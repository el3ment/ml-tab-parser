#3 in USA and top of charts in UK in '67.  
#1. 
<span>C</span>                  <span>D7</span> 
Some girls love to run around
        <span>F</span>           <span>G</span>          <span>C</span> 
like to handle everything they see. 
<span>C</span>                    <span>D7</span> 
But my girl has more fun around, 
        <span>F</span>                 <span>G</span>       <span>C</span> 
and you know she'd rather be with me. 
  
CHORUS:  
<span>C</span>       <span>C7</span>                      <span>F</span> 
Me..oh..my, lucky guy is what I am, 
         <span>D7</span>              <span>Bb</span> 
tell you why you'll understand, 
          <span>G</span>                <span>C</span>   <span>G#</span> <span>G</span> 
she don't fly although she can. 
#2.  
     <span>C</span>            <span>D7</span> 
Some boys love to run around, 
           <span>F</span>               <span>G</span>           <span>C</span>
they don't think about the things they do. 
<span>C</span>                     <span>D7</span> 
But this boy wants to settle down, 
        <span>F</span>                <span>G</span>       <span>C</span> 
and you know he'd rather be with you. 
  
CHORUS: 
REPEAT#1.
ADD:
  <span>F</span>                    <span>G7</span>   
I know she'd rather be with... 
<span>F</span>                    <span>G7</span>  
know she'd rather be with...
  <span>F</span>                 <span>G7</span>      <span>C</span> 
I know she'd rather be with me.   

A sixties smash from Kraziekhat.
