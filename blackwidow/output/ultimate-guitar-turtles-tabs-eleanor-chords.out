<span>Dm</span>                               <span>Gm</span> 
You  got  a  thing  about  you,  I  just  can't  

live  without  you,
<span>A7</span>                              <span>Dm</span>         <span>Bb</span>  <span>A7</span> 
I  really  want  you  Elenore,  near  me...
<span>Dm</span>                           <span>Gm</span> 
Your  looks  intoxicate  me  even  though 

your  folks  hate  me, 
<span>A7</span>                                    <span>Dm</span>      <span>A</span>/<span>Bb</span>/<span>A</span>/
There's  no  one  like  you  Elenore  really! 

CHORUS:
<span>D</span>                                 <span>DM7</span>                
Elenore,  gee,  I  think  you're  swell,
                          <span>G</span> 
And  you  really  do  me  well, 
            <span>D</span>                   <span>A</span>     <span>A7</span> 
You're  my  pride  and  joy,  etcetera.
<span>Gm</span>                          <span>Am7</span>                          
Elenore  can  I  take  the  time, 
                               <span>A</span>                                                
To  ask  you  to  speak  your  mind,
<span>A7</span>                             <span>D</span>     <span>Bb</span> <span>A</span> <span>A7</span>    
Tell  me  that  you  love  me  better.             
                                                                                      
#2. 
<span>Dm</span>                                <span>Gm</span> 
I  really  think  you're  groovy  let's 
                <span>Gm7</span>
go  out  to  a  movie.
<span>A</span>                         <span>A7</span>        <span>Dm</span>       <span>Bb</span> <span>A7</span> 
What  do  you  say  now,  Elenore,  can  we?
<span>Dm</span> 
They'll  turn  the  lights way down low 
<span>Gm</span> 
Maybe  we  won't  watch  the  show     
<span>A</span>                   <span>A7</span>       <span>Dm</span>       <span>A</span>  <span>Bb</span>  <span>A</span>  
I think I love you, Elenore, love  me.

CHORUS:
REPEAT#2.

<span>D</span>                                <span>DM7</span>         <span>A7</span> 
Eleanore  gee  I  think  you're  swell...ah, ha. (x4) 
    <span>D</span> 
ah, ha, aaaa... 
 
A sixties smash from Kraziekhat.
