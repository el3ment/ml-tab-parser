                            IN A LONELY PLACE
                                      by, The Smithereens
(INTRO)
<span>E</span>-///|<span>D9</span>///|<span>A9</span>///|<span>B7</span>///|

<span>E</span>-           <span>D9</span>
Ive heard it said somewhere that
<span>A9</span>               <span>B7</span>                <span>E</span>-
One day all good things come to an end,
                   <span>D9</span>
I turned around to see you,
<span>A9</span>         <span>B7</span>            CMAJ7
If I do or not at all depends
               <span>B7</span>
I was born the day i met you,
CMAJ7         <span>D</span>
Lived a while when you loved me,
CMAJ7         <span>B7</span>             <span>E</span>-
Died a little when we broke apart,
CMAJ7        <span>B7</span>
Yesterday it would have mattered,
CMAJ7        <span>D</span>              CMAJ7
Now today it doesn't mean a thing,
                 <span>B7</span>                    <span>E</span>-   <span>B7</span>
All my hopes and dreams are shattered, now.
<span>E</span>-       <span>D9</span>               <span>A9</span>       <span>B7</span>
I'm in a lonely place without you,
<span>E</span>-       <span>D9</span>               <span>A9</span>       <span>B7</span>
I'm in a lonely place without you.
<span>E</span>-         <span>D9</span>               <span>A9</span>
I walk the streets alone at night
               <span>B7</span>
Sometimes, and think about you,
<span>E</span>-          <span>D9</span>
I watch the strangers pass
    <span>A9</span>              <span>B7</span>                 CMAJ7
And wonder how I've lived without your love
               <span>B7</span>
I was born the day I met you,
CMAJ7         <span>D</span>
Lived a while when you loved me,
CMAJ7         <span>B7</span>             <span>E</span>-
Died a little when we broke apart.
CMAJ7         <span>B7</span>               CMAJ7
Suddenly this worlds no longer bright,
              <span>D</span>            <span>CMA7</span>
I'm alone and lonely every night,
                          <span>B7</span>                 <span>E</span>-    <span>B7</span>
Won't you bring back your love that's out of sight.
<span>E</span>-       <span>D9</span>               <span>A9</span>       <span>B7</span>
I'm in a lonely place without you,
<span>E</span>-       <span>D9</span>               <span>A9</span>       <span>B7</span>
I'm in a lonely place without you.
(REPEAT AND FADE)
<span>E</span>-       <span>D9</span>               <span>A9</span>       <span>B7</span>
I'm in a lonely place without you...</rs8527>
