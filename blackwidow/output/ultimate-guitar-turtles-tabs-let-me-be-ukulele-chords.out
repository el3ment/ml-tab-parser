Let Me Be chords
The Turtles *

<span>D</span> <span>A</span>  <span>D</span> <span>E</span>

<span>D</span>               <span>E</span>        <span>D</span>         <span>E</span>
Please don't mistake me, or try to make me
    <span>D</span>         <span>E</span>       <span>A</span>
The shadow of anybody else
<span>D</span>           <span>E</span>      <span>D</span>               <span>E</span>
I ain't the him or her you think I am
         <span>D</span>      <span>E</span>            <span>A</span>
I'm just trying hard to be myself
    <span>E</span>                       <span>A</span>
Oh, society's goal is to be part of the whole
         <span>D</span>                         <span>E</span>
That may sound good to you, not to me

       <span>A</span>
Let me be, let me be
   <span>D</span>            <span>E</span>
To think like I want to
       <span>A</span>
Let me be, let me be
       <span>D</span>         <span>E</span>
That's all I ask of you
  <span>D</span>                       <span>C#m</span>   <span>Bm</span>       <span>A</span>
I am what I am and that's all I ever can be

<span>D</span> <span>A</span>  <span>D</span> <span>E</span>

<span>D</span>            <span>E</span>       <span>D</span>       <span>E</span>
Don't try to plan me or understand me
  <span>D</span>     <span>E</span>                <span>A</span>
I can't stand to be understood
<span>D</span>                  <span>E</span>     <span>D</span>            <span>E</span>
I could never give in to or ever live up to
      <span>D</span>        <span>E</span>       <span>A</span>
Being like you think I should
         <span>E</span>                         <span>A</span>
I've got some inner need which I'm trying to heed
        <span>D</span>                      <span>E</span>
I can't take hand me down destiny

       <span>A</span>
Let me be, let me be
   <span>D</span>            <span>E</span>
To think like I want to
       <span>A</span>
Let me be, let me be
       <span>D</span>         <span>E</span>
That's all I ask of you
  <span>D</span>                       <span>C#m</span>   <span>Bm</span>       <span>A</span>
I am what I am and that's all I ever can be

<span>D</span>            <span>E</span>         <span>D</span>      <span>E</span>
Don't try to change me or rearrange me
   <span>D</span>    <span>E</span>                     <span>A</span>
To satisfy the selfishness of you
<span>D</span>         <span>E</span>                <span>D</span>                       <span>E</span>
I'm not a piece of clay to mold to your moves each day
        <span>D</span>     <span>E</span>                      <span>A</span>
And I'm not a pawn to be told how to move
              <span>D</span>                              <span>E</span>
I'm sorry I'm not the fool you thought would play by your rules
       <span>D</span>        <span>E</span>           <span>A</span>
But to each his own philosophy

       <span>A</span>
Let me be, let me be
   <span>D</span>            <span>E</span>
To think like I want to
       <span>A</span>
Let me be, let me be
       <span>D</span>         <span>E</span>
That's all I ask of you
  <span>D</span>                       <span>C#m</span>   <span>Bm</span>       <span>A</span>
I am what I am and that's all I ever can be
              <span>D</span>     <span>E</span>        <span>A</span>
I said that's all I ever can be  3x
