<span>G</span>                                  <span>D</span> 
I got a couch sittin in a storage shed
<span>C</span>                                                        <span>D</span>
A few photograph pictures and my old flat bed
<span>G</span>                                                     <span>D</span>    
A pair of boots with a worn down tread
<span>C</span>                                         <span>D</span>
And some books collecting dust..

<span>G</span>                                           <span>D</span> 
A good dog and a handful of friends
<span>C</span>                                         <span>D</span>
It's been awhile since I've seen them
<span>G</span>                                       <span>D</span>           
I'm aways-away don't know till when
<span>C</span>                                   <span>D</span>
but that's ok because....


CHORUS:
<span>Em</span>                <span>C</span>                <span>G</span>
Just cuz you can't see it
<span>D</span>                             <span>G</span>
Doesn't-mean it isn't there
<span>Em</span>        <span>C</span>          <span>G</span>
I know I can feel it
<span>D</span>                       <span>Dsus</span>
All the way from here

<span>Em</span>                <span>C</span>                <span>G</span>
While there's miles between us
<span>D</span>                             <span>G</span>
And it hurts to be apart
<span>Em</span>       <span>C</span>                     <span>G</span>
Home's a place that's far away
            <span>D</span>           <span>C</span>          <span>G</span>
But it's right here in my heart.


<span>G</span>                                     <span>D</span> 
Some days I feel like my only friend
<span>C</span>                                                        <span>D</span>
Is the gun on my hip and the beer in my hand
<span>G</span>                                           <span>D</span>    
People out here just don't understand
<span>C</span>                          <span>D</span>
What all I'm made from

<span>G</span>                                           <span>D</span> 
It's days like this that I gotta recall
<span>C</span>                                         <span>D</span>
It isn't for good and that this isn't all
<span>G</span>                                                  <span>D</span>           
And I might just have-to -give you a call
<span>C</span>                                   <span>D</span>
To remind me of the truth...

<span>Em</span>                <span>C</span>                <span>G</span>
That just cuz you can't see it
<span>D</span>                             <span>G</span>
Doesn't-mean it isn't there
<span>Em</span>        <span>C</span>          <span>G</span>
I know I can feel it
<span>D</span>                       <span>Dsus</span>
All the way from here

<span>Em</span>                <span>C</span>                <span>G</span>
While there's miles between us
<span>D</span>                             <span>G</span>
And it hurts to be apart
<span>Em</span>       <span>C</span>                     <span>G</span>
Home's a place that's far away
            <span>D</span>        <span>C</span>              <span>G</span>
But it's right here in my heart.
