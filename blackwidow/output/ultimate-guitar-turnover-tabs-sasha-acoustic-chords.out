<span>C</span>                      <span>Fmaj7</span>                      
I called you up to say goodnight
                               <span>Am</span>
I thought that things would be alright
      <span>G</span>              <span>Fmaj7</span>
But I guess I was dead wrong
<span>C</span>                       <span>Fmaj7</span>
And I just want to stay asleep 
                                  <span>Am</span>
Because thoughts of you are all I dream 
         <span>G</span>            <span>Fmaj7</span>
But when I wake up you're gone

Chorus:
<span>Fmaj7</span>                                <span>Am</span>
For weeks the days I spent felt like forever
           <span>G</span>             <span>Fmaj7</span>
I couldn't get you off my mind
                       <span>Am</span>
I wondered how you got inside my head
            <span>G</span>                   <span>Fmaj7</span>
And made me think that you were mine
                                <span>Am</span>
I thought you meant it when you said forever
  <span>G</span>                <span>Fmaj7</span>
I guess that was a lie
                             <span>Am</span>
I still get choked up when I think of you
   <span>G</span>               <span>Fmaj7</span>
It happens all the time

<span>C</span>                                    <span>Fmaj7</span>
Well there's a place that we used to go
                       <span>Am</span>
I pass by now and feel alone
           <span>G</span>           <span>Fmaj7</span>
And wonder if you ever stop here like I do
<span>C</span>                             <span>Fmaj7</span>
And someone told me that they saw you there one night
         <span>Am</span>                <span>G</span> 
Skipping rocks down by the water
    <span>Fmaj7</span>
All alone, tears in your eyes

Chorus

<span>Fmaj7</span>           <span>Am</span>
Your time's all gone
     <span>G</span>        <span>Fmaj7</span>
It's all been spent
                      <span>Am</span>     <span>G</span>
Who's left by your side



    <span>G</span>         <span>Fmaj7</span>
Not me anymore
