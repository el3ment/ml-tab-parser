%%%% Tab:<i></i>Turin Brakes - Red Moon
Tabbed by Carol McSweeney

From their 3rd album, ‘Jackinabox’.  NB: there’s a really nice acoustic version of
this on their new EP if you can get hold of it…



<span>Bm</span>    <span>A</span>      <span>G</span>
Ooooh Oooh ooooooh 

<span>A</span>    <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>      <span>G</span>    <span>E</span>
Oooh Oooooh       Oooh Oooooh  (x2)




<span>Bm</span>        <span>A</span>            <span>E</span>     <span>Bm</span> <span>A</span> <span>E</span>
Sometimes just letting go is easier

<span>Bm</span>   <span>A</span>                  <span>E</span>             <span>Bm</span>       <span>A</span>         <span>E</span>
Dead friends can’t come back, they’re gone and life goes on

        <span>A</span>               <span>G</span>              <span>A</span>               <span>G</span>
If you try, you’ll be alright, If you try, you’ll be alright


Chorus:

<span>Bm</span>           <span>A</span>     <span>G</span>             
I’m hanging around you

                   <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>    <span>A</span>                       
We’re catching the star-      light

             <span>G</span>    <span>E</span>
Underneath a red moon

<span>Bm</span>                <span>A</span>      <span>G</span>  
We’re leaving the city tonight

                  <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>    <span>A</span>
We’re finding our free-       dom

             <span>G</span>   <span>E</span>
Underneath a red moon





<span>Bm</span>    <span>A</span>           <span>E</span>
Leave your woes behind

<span>Bm</span>        <span>A</span>       <span>E</span>
Start the car and drive

<span>Bm</span> <span>A</span>              <span>E</span>
Deserts bring you home

    <span>Bm</span>   <span>A</span>            <span>E</span>
The only roads you’ve known




Chorus


<span>Bm</span>      <span>G</span>
Here it comes

    <span>Am</span>       <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
You might as well

<span>Bm</span>      <span>G</span>
Here it comes

    <span>Am</span>       <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
You might as well

    <span>Am</span>       <span>Dmaj7</span>/<span>F#</span>
You might as well


If you try…
