%%%% Tab:<i></i>Absolutely great song by the Smithereens, and easy to play and sing.  The chorus 
could be subdivided more but this charts a solid course.  There is some controvery 
about the girl named.  The right name is Jeannie Shrimpton, an "it girl" from the 
1960s, check her out on Google Images.  Good Luck,  John Pineau

<span>Dm</span>                                  <span>C</span>  
She had hair like Jeannie Shrimpton back in 1965
        <span>Dm</span>                           <span>Dm</span>  
She had legs that never ended, I was halfway paralyzed
                                         <span>C</span>
She was tall and cool and pretty and she dressed as black as coal
       <span>Dm</span>                              <span>Dm</span>
If she asked me to I'd murder, I would gladly lose my soul

CHORUS:
<span>C</span>                    <span>Dm</span>             
Now I lie in bed and think of her 
<span>C</span>                <span>Dm</span> 
Sometimes I even weep
       <span>Dm</span>           <span>C</span>                <span>Dm</span>
Then I dream of her behind a wall of sleep


<span>Dm</span>                                      <span>C</span>
Well she held a bass guitar and she was playing in a band
        <span>Dm</span>                                <span>Dm</span>
And she stood just like Bill Wyman, now I am her biggest fan
                                     <span>C</span>                         
Now I know I'm one of many who would like to be your friend 
         <span>Dm</span>                                    <span>Dm</span> 
And I've got to find a way to let you know I'm not one of them

[CHORUS]

<span>Dm</span>                                        <span>C</span>
Got your number from a friend of mine who lives in your home town
           <span>Dm</span>                              <span>Dm</span>  
Called you up to have a drink your roomate said you weren't around
                                     <span>C</span>
Now I know I'm one of many who would like to be your friend 
         <span>Dm</span>                                    <span>Dm</span>
And I've got to find a way to let you know I'm not like them

[CHORUS]
<span>Dm</span>       <span>C</span>       <span>Dm</span> 
Behind a wall of sleep
<span>Dm</span>       <span>C</span>       <span>Dm</span>
Behind a wall of sleep
<span>Dm</span>       <span>C</span>       <span>Dm</span>
Behind a wall of sleep
