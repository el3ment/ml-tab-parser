%%%% Tab:<i></i>This is the version of Bittersweet Symphony sung by Megan Hilty which was played on the
TV show SMASH. This is probably my favorite cover of the song so I decided to figure out
the chords for it. This is my first time but Iâ€™m about 90% certain that this is correct 
(I have a good ear lol). If Bm7 is a struggle Bm works fine as well. Good luck and enjoy =]

Capo on 4th fret.
