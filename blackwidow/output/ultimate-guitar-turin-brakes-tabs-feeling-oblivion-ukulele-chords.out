Intro chords: <span>G5</span> / <span>C5</span>+<span>D</span> / <span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>

<span>G</span>                      <span>Cmaj9</span>                 <span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>              <span>D/F#</span>
Cubscouts are screaming needing icecreaming & all the pleasures of June
<span>G</span>                   <span>Cmaj9</span>                   <span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>                 <span>D/F#</span>
I'm in a parked car. Flowers seem friendly & people in hallways feel walls
<span>G</span>                    <span>Cmaj9</span>                   <span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>         <span>D/F#</span>
Now it is night time, maybe we're cruising avoiding the anti-cruise
<span>G</span>                      CCmaj9     <span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>
Oh, I don't really know where we are

<span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>       <span>Am</span>
If things get real
<span>Am</span>         <span>C</span>                 <span>G</span>   <span>D/F#</span>
Promise to take me somewhere elll-se
<span>D/F#</span>   <span>Am</span>                 <span>C</span>                     <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
By the time fear takes me over will we still be roll-ing
<span>D</span>                      <span>G</span>
...and feeling oblivion

(Play intro chords twice)

<span>G</span>                  <span>Cmaj9</span>                 <span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>                   <span>D/F#</span>
Once in a while the lie in a laughter can burn through a hole in my ears
<span>D/F#</span>   <span>G</span>
Like a man with glasses
<span>Cmaj9</span>                 <span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>               <span>D/F#</span>
Catching a sunbeam and burning the skin of a kid
<span>G</span>                    <span>Cmaj9</span>                 <span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>  <span>D/F#</span>
Hypereal fragments disturbing the stagnants of almighty fear
<span>D/F#</span> <span>G</span>                     <span>Cmaj9</span> <span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>
Well I'll just go under the waaa-ter

<span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>       <span>Am</span>
If things get real
<span>Am</span>         <span>C</span>                 <span>G</span>    <span>D/F#</span>
Promise to take me somewhere elll-se
<span>D/F#</span>   <span>Am</span>                 <span>C</span>                     <span>G</span>   <span>D</span>
By the time fear takes me over will we still be roll-ing
<span>D</span>                      <span>G</span>
...and feeling oblivion

(Play intro chords twice)

<span>G</span>      <span>Cmaj9</span>  <span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>
So don't leave me
<span>G</span>   <span>Cmaj9</span>  <span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>
Here on my own
<span>G</span>       <span>Cmaj9</span>  <span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>
So don't leave me
<span>G</span>   <span>Cmaj9</span>  <span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>
Here on my own

<span>Gmaj7</span>+<span>D</span>       <span>Am</span>
If things get real
<span>Am</span>         <span>C</span>                 <span>G</span>   <span>D/F#</span>
Promise to take me somewhere elll-se
<span>D/F#</span>   <span>Am</span>                 <span>C</span>                     <span>G</span>   <span>D</span>
By the time fear takes me over will we still be roll-ing
<span>D</span>                      <span>G</span>
...and feeling oblivion
