It Ain t Me Babe
The Turtles (Bob Dylan) *

<span>G</span> <span>Am</span>

    <span>G</span>           <span>Am</span>
Go away from my window,
<span>Bm</span>            <span>D</span>          <span>G</span>
leave at your own chosen speed.
                    <span>Am</span>
I'm not the one you want, babe,
    <span>Bm</span>      <span>D</span>       <span>G</span>
I'm not the one you need.
    <span>Bm</span>                 <span>Am</span>
You say you're looking for someone,
            <span>Bm</span>              <span>Am</span>
who’s never weak but always strong
      <span>Bm</span>             <span>Am</span>
To protect you and defend you,
        <span>Bm</span>               <span>Am</span>
whether you are right or wrong
<span>C</span>                              <span>D</span>
Someone to open each and every door

             <span>G</span>
But it ain't me, babe,
<span>C</span>       <span>D</span>            <span>G</span>
no, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
         <span>C</span>         <span>D</span>       <span>G</span>
it ain't me you're looking for, babe.

<span>G</span> <span>Am</span>  <span>Bm</span> <span>D</span> <span>G</span>

   <span>G</span>                <span>Am</span>
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
   <span>Bm</span>      <span>D</span>      <span>G</span>
go lightly on the ground.
                    <span>Am</span>
I'm not the one you want, babe,
     <span>Bm</span>   <span>D</span>       <span>G</span>
I’ll only let you down.
    <span>Bm</span>                 <span>Am</span>
You say you're looking for someone,
         <span>Bm</span>               <span>Am</span>
who will promise never to part
    <span>Bm</span>               <span>Am</span>
Someone to close his eyes for you,
    <span>Bm</span>               <span>Am</span>
someone to close his heart
    <span>C</span>                            <span>D</span>
Someone who will die for you and more
             
             <span>G</span>
But it ain't me, babe,
<span>C</span>       <span>D</span>            <span>G</span>
no, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
         <span>C</span>         <span>D</span>       <span>G</span>
it ain't me you're looking for, babe.
         <span>C</span>         <span>D</span>       <span>G</span>
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.

       <span>C</span>       <span>D</span>            <span>G</span>
I said no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
       <span>C</span>       <span>D</span>            <span>G</span>
I said no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
       <span>C</span>       <span>D</span>            <span>G</span>
I said no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
       <span>C</span>       <span>D</span>            <span>G</span>
I said no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
