Intro: <span>F#</span> <span>Bm</span>/<span>C</span> x2

     <span>F#</span>
Fade in on a girl
        <span>D#m</span>
With a hunger for fame
       <span>B</span>          <span>Bm</span>          <span>F#</span>  <span>A#m</span>
And a face and a name to remember.
    <span>D#m</span>
The past fades away
        <span>B</span>
Because as of this day
              <span>E</span>
Norma Jean's gone,
             <span>Bm</span>/<span>C</span>   
She's moving on.
     
     <span>F#</span>
Her smile and your fantasies
<span>A#dim</span>
Play a duet
           <span>B</span>          
That will make you forget
           <span>E</span>  <span>B</span>
Where you are.
     <span>F#</span>           <span>A#m</span>
The music starts playing
         <span>D#m</span>
It's the beat of her heart saying,
<span>E</span>       <span>B</span>         <span>F#</span>  <span>Bm</span>/<span>C</span>  <span>F#</span>  <span>Bm</span>/<span>C</span>
"Let me be your star."

       <span>F#</span>
Flash back to a girl
       <span>D#m</span>
With a song in her heart
          <span>B</span>          <span>Bm</span>          <span>F#</span>     <span>A#m</span>
As she's waiting to start the adventure.
     <span>D#m</span>
The fire and drive
            <span>B</span>
That make dreams come alive,
               <span>E</span>
They fill her soul.
            <span>Bm</span>/<span>C</span>
She's in control.

     <span>F#</span>
The drama, the laughter,
    <span>A#dim</span>
The tears just like pearls.
               <span>B</span>                       <span>E</span>    <span>B</span>
Well, they're all in this girl's repertoire.
      <span>F#</span>          <span>A#m</span>
It's all for the taking,
          <span>D#m</span>
And it's magic we'll be making.
<span>E</span>      <span>B</span>        <span>F#</span>  <span>Bm</span>/<span>C</span>  <span>F#</span>
Let me be your star.
            
                     <span>A#</span>
I'll just have to forget the hurt that came before,
   <span>F#M</span>
Forget what used to be.
     <span>B</span>              <span>G#m</span>
The past is on the cutting room floor,
     <span>B</span>        <span>C7</span>        <span>C#</span>
The future is here with me.
       <span>D7</span>
Choose me!

     <span>G</span>
Fade up on a star
        <span>Em</span>
With it all in her sights:
         <span>C</span>            <span>Cm</span>
All the love and the lights
         <span>G</span>        <span>Bm</span>
That surround her.
    <span>Em</span>
Someday she'll think twice
        <span>C</span>
Of the dues and the price
                <span>F</span>
She'll have to pay
(She'll have to pay)
         <span>Cm</span>/<span>Db</span>
But not today
(But not today)

            <span>G</span>
Then she'll do all she can
        <span>Bdim</span>
For the love of one man
         <span>C</span>                       <span>F</span> <span>C</span>
And for millions who look from afar.
     <span>G</span>                <span>Bm</span>
And what you've been needing
        <span>Em</span>
Is all here and my heart's pleading.
<span>F</span>      <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>   <span>Cm</span>/<span>Db</span>  <span>G</span>  <span>Cm</span>/<span>Db</span>  <span>G</span>  <span>Cm</span>/<span>Db</span>  <span>G</span>
Let me be your star!
