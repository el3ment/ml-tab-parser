INTRO: <span>D</span> <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>E</span>(x2)

#1.
<span>D</span>            <span>E</span>           <span>D</span>         <span>E</span>
Please don't mistake me, or try to make me,
    <span>D</span>         <span>E</span>       <span>A</span>    <span>D</span> <span>A</span>
the shadow of anybody else.
<span>D</span>           <span>E</span>      <span>D</span>               <span>E</span>
I ain't the him or her you think I am,
         <span>D</span>      <span>E</span>            <span>A</span>
I'm just trying hard to be myself.
        <span>E</span>                       <span>A</span>
Though, society's goal is to be part of the whole,
         <span>D</span>                         <span>E</span>  <span>E7</span>
that may sound good to you, not to me.

CHORUS:
       <span>A</span>                 <span>D</span>                 <span>E</span>
Let me be, let me be..to think like I want to.
       <span>A</span>                         <span>D</span>        <span>E</span>
Let me be, let me be..that's all I ask of you.
  <span>D</span>                       <span>C#m</span>    <span>Bm</span>       <span>D</span>  <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>E</span>
I am what I am and that's all, I ever can be.

#2.
<span>D</span>            <span>E</span>       <span>D</span>        <span>E</span>
Don't try to plan me or understand me,
  <span>D</span>              <span>E</span>       <span>A</span>    <span>D</span> <span>A</span>
I can't stand to be understood.
        <span>D</span>          <span>E</span>         <span>D</span>            <span>E</span>
I could never give in to, or ever live up to,
<span>D</span>          <span>E</span>           <span>A</span>
being like you think I should.
         <span>E</span>                         <span>A</span>
I've got some inner need which I'm tryin' to heed,
        <span>D</span>                 <span>E</span>      <span>E7</span>
I can't take hand-me-down destiny.

CHORUS:
       <span>A</span>                 <span>D</span>                 <span>E</span>
Let me be, let me be..to think like I want to.
       <span>A</span>                         <span>D</span>        <span>E</span>
Let me be, let me be..that's all I ask of you.
  <span>D</span>                       <span>C#m</span>    <span>Bm</span>       <span>D</span>  <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>E</span>
I am what I am and that's all, I ever can be.

#3.
<span>D</span>            <span>E</span>            <span>D</span> <span>E</span>
Don't try to change me or rearrange me,
   <span>D</span>           <span>E</span>              <span>A</span>  <span>D</span> <span>A</span>   
to satisfy the selfishness of you.
    <span>D</span>              <span>E</span>                <span>D</span>                <span>E</span>
I'm not a piece of clay, to mold to your moves, each day..
        <span>D</span>             <span>E</span>              <span>A</span>
and I'm not a pawn to be told how to move.
          <span>E</span>                                  <span>A</span>
I'm sorry I'm not the fool you thought would play 
                      <span>D</span>                    <span>E</span>   <span>E7</span>
by your rules...a 'to-each-his-own' philosophy.

CHORUS:
       <span>A</span>                 <span>D</span>                 <span>E</span>
Let me be, let me be..to think like I want to.
       <span>A</span>                         <span>D</span>        <span>E</span>
Let me be, let me be..that's all I ask of you.
  <span>D</span>                       <span>C#m</span>    <span>Bm</span>       <span>D</span>  <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>E</span>
I am what I am and that's all, I ever can be.

OUTRO:
               <span>D</span>     <span>E</span>        <span>A</span>       
I said, that's all I ever can be.
               <span>D</span>     <span>E</span>        <span>A</span>       
I said, that's all I ever can be.
               <span>D</span>     <span>E</span>        <span>A</span>       
I said, that's all I ever can be.(Fade.)
