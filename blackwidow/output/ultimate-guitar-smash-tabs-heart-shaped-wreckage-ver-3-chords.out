<span>E</span>
I'm not scared to tell the truth
<span>C#m</span>
I've been to hell and back, and I went with you
<span>A</span>
Remind me what we were before
  <span>B</span>
When we said you are mine and I am yours

<span>E</span>
I don't know much, but I know myself
<span>C#m</span>
And I don't want to love anybody else
<span>A</span>
So let's break the spell and lift the curse
<span>B</span>
Remember when we fell for each other head first

<span>E</span>
Look at this heart shaped wreckage
<span>B</span>
What have we done?
<span>C#m</span>                <span>A</span>
We've got scars from battles nobody won
        <span>E</span>
We can start over, better
<span>B</span>                   <span>C#m</span>    
Both of us know if we just let the broken pieces
<span>A</span>
Let the broken pieces go

<span>E</span>
I can't find you in the dark
<span>C#m</span>
Will we get back to who we are?
<span>A</span>
And I can't fix this on my own
       <span>B</span>            
Our love is still the best thing I've ever known

<span>E</span>
Look at this heart shaped wreckage
<span>B</span>
What have we done?
<span>C#m</span>                <span>A</span>
We've got scars from battles nobody won
        <span>E</span>
We can start over, better
<span>B</span>                   <span>C#m</span>    
Both of us know if we just let the broken pieces
<span>A</span>            <span>E</span>
Let the broken pieces go

<span>A</span>            <span>C#m</span>
Let the broken pieces go
<span>A</span>            <span>E</span>        <span>B</span>
Just hold on to each other tonight, oh

<span>E</span>

Let the broken pieces 
<span>A</span>            
Let the broken pieces 
<span>A</span>        <span>B</span>    <span>E</span>
Let the broken pieces
