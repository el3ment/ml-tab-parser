%%%% Tab:<i></i>                <span>Am</span>
I'm waken up
Without you here
        <span>C</span>
It's sinking in so loud and clear
     <span>G</span>                    <span>D</span>
Its over, guess its over

          <span>Am</span>
Wish I could take it back
and fight again
    <span>C</span>
I can't rewind,
Undo what's done
       <span>G</span>
It's no redemption for me
          <span>D</span>
Never written out this story

 <span>Am</span>                     <span>C</span>
One mistake, got one regret
     <span>G</span>                                     <span>D</span>
A memory, I know you can't forget

          <span>Am</span>
I'm a prisoner
                   <span>C</span>
And there's no way out
                  <span>G</span>
Cause the future Past
                                       <span>D</span>
I'm stuck in the here and now

-Chorus-
               <span>G</span>
No time machine
                 <span>Dm</span>
Could ever bring us back
           <span>Am</span>
No apology
                   <span>C</span>
Is gonna get this on track
                    <span>G</span>
I could wait around
               <span>Dm</span>
For a thousand years
   <span>Am</span>
But that will never change us
                                      <span>C</span>
If I'm gonna bring us back
                         <span>G</span>
I need a time machine
     <span>Dm</span>                     <span>Am</span>
Oohhh,... I need a time machine,...
   <span>C</span>
Ooo,...

   <span>Am</span>
I crossed the line
I broke the rule
    <span>C</span>
I hate myself,
For hurting you
      <span>G</span>
My conscience
Weighs so heavy
          <span>D</span>
Like a boulder since you left me
 <span>Am</span>
Even though it kills me
I gotta let you go
      <span>C</span>
I'm fallin to pieces
And you won't even know
       <span>G</span>
The pain inside
                   <span>D</span>
Of seeing me alive


 <span>Am</span>                     <span>C</span>
One mistake, got one regret
     <span>G</span>                                     <span>D</span>
A memory, I know you can't forget

-Chorus-
                 <span>G</span>
No time machine
                               <span>Dm</span>
Could ever bring us back
              <span>Am</span>
And no apology
                     <span>C</span>
Is gonna get this on track
                   <span>G</span>
I could wait around
                        <span>Dm</span>
For a thousand years
 <span>Am</span>
But that will never
                                                   <span>C</span>
Change us if I'm gonna bring us back,...

-Bridge-
                      <span>Am</span>
I need a time machine
        <span>Am</span>                     <span>Am</span>
The fastest there's ever been
                                           <span>C</span>
So I could get you back with me
<span>Am</span>              <span>D</span>                  <span>Am</span>
Rewind and long live the past
     <span>C</span>                              <span>Am</span>
Never wanted anything so bad   
             <span>C</span>
How can I move on,
          <span>Am</span>
cause now that
        <span>C</span>                                  <span>D</span>
my future has become your past


-Chorus-
                 <span>G</span>
No time machine
                               <span>Dm</span>
Could ever bring us back
              <span>Am</span>
And no apology
                     <span>C</span>
Is gonna get this on track
                   <span>G</span>
I could wait around
                        <span>Dm</span>
For a thousand years
 <span>Am</span>
But that will never
                                                   <span>C</span>
Change us if I'm gonna bring us back,...

     <span>G</span>
If only I could change us
  <span>Am</span>                           <span>C</span>
If only I could bring us back
                        <span>G</span>
Gimme a time machine,...
 <span>Dm</span>                        <span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>
oOo,.... Give me a time machine
                         <span>G</span>
Give me a time machine
