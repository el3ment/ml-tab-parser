%%%% Tab:<i></i>Great song! The original is in Eb, if you want to play along, just tune down a 
half step. The kick-in-the-pants here is the D to Em. At the start of the verse, 
the beat is on the 3 and the 4 of the bar. The other D to Em (I've indicated by 
parentheses) the beat is on the "and 4 and" (8th notes) of the bar. 
Intro   (<span>D</span>)     <span>Em</span>      (<span>D</span>)     <span>Em</span>
Verse 1
<span>D</span>            <span>Em</span>                                            <span>G</span> 
She had hair like Jeannie Shrimpton back in 1965
<span>Am</span>                                              (<span>D</span>)     <span>Em</span> 
She had legs that never ended, I was halfway paralyzed
<span>D</span>                                                           <span>Em</span>  <span>G</span>
She was tall and cool and pretty and she dressed as black as coal
<span>Am</span>                                                  (<span>D</span>) <span>Em</span>
If she asked me to I'd murder, I would gladly lose my soul
Chorus
<span>G</span>                              <span>Em</span> 
Now I lie in bed and think of her 
<span>G</span>                          <span>Em</span> 
Sometimes I even weep
        <span>Am</span>                             <span>D</span>                  <span>Em</span>
Then I dream of her behind a wall of sleep
Verse 2
<span>D</span>       <span>Em</span>                                                    <span>G</span>
Well she held a bass guitar and she was playing in a band
<span>Am</span>                                                     (<span>D</span>)      <span>Em</span>
And she stood just like Bill Wyman, now I am her biggest fan
<span>D</span>       <span>Em</span>                                              <span>G</span>
Now I know I'm one of many who would like to be your friend 
<span>Am</span>                                          (<span>D</span>) <span>Em</span>
And I've got to find a way to let you know I'm not like them
Chorus
Verse 3
<span>D</span>       <span>Em</span>      <span>G</span>       <span>Am</span>      (<span>D</span>)     <span>Em</span>
(Instrumental)
<span>D</span>       <span>Em</span>      <span>G</span>       <span>Am</span>      (<span>D</span>)     <span>Em</span>
(Instrumental)
Chorus  
Verse 4
<span>D</span>       <span>Em</span>                                                           <span>G</span>
Got your number from a friend of mine who lives in your home town
<span>Am</span>                                                  (<span>D</span>) <span>Em</span>
Called you up to have a drink your roommate said you weren't around
<span>D</span>                                                   <span>Em</span>  <span>G</span>
Now I know I'm one of many who would like to be your friend 
<span>Am</span>                                                       (<span>D</span>)    <span>Em</span>
And I've got to find a way to let you know I'm not like them
Chorus
Outro
<span>Am</span>            <span>G</span> <span>Em</span> 
Behind a wall of sleep
<span>Am</span>            <span>G</span> <span>Em</span>
Behind a wall of sleep
<span>Am</span>            <span>G</span> <span>Em</span>
Behind a wall of sleep
(<span>D</span>)     <span>Em</span>      (<span>D</span>)     <span>Em</span>      <span>D</span>       <span>Em</span>
