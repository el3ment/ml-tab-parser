Verse 1
<span>AM</span>      <span>G</span>            <span>D</span>              <span>EM</span>
My mind is filled with thoughts of you
<span>AM</span>      <span>G</span>            <span>D</span>              <span>EM</span>
I think about the days of two
<span>AM</span>      <span>G</span>            <span>D</span>              <span>EM</span>
I search the room but you're not there
<span>AM</span>      <span>G</span>            <span>D</span>              <span>EM</span>
Your perfume lingers everywhere

Chorus
But it's
<span>F</span>                  <span>EM</span>
Only a memory
<span>F</span>                                    <span>G</span>
Of what our love was going to be
<span>D</span>                <span>EM</span>
Only a memory
<span>F</span>                              <span>G</span>
Broken bits of you and me
<span>D</span>              <span>EM</span>
Only a memory
<span>F</span>              <span>G</span>                        <span>D</span>
Only a memory

Verse 2
In a world of pain I have no peer
You fade away and disappear
And no I have to learn the game
Where no one wins or takes the blame
But it's
Chorus
Only a memory
Of what our love was going to be
Only a memory
Now that we are history
Only a memory
Only a memory

But it's
Only a memory
Of what our love was going to be
Only a memory
Broken bits of you and me
Only a memory
Only a memory

Chorus
Verse 3
Why should it matter if I cry
I sit around and wonder why
Now I feel much too weak to live
And I've got nothing left to give
Now it's

Chorus
Only a memory
Of what our love was going to be
Only a memory
Broken bits of you and me
Only a memory
Only a memory
Only a memory
(Fade)
