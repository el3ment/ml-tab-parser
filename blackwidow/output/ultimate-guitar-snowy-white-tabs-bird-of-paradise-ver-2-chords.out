Saw you flying by
<span>F</span>                   <span>Bb</span>  <span>C</span>*
Flash of Turquoise Blue
<span>Bb</span>*              <span>Dm</span>   <span>C</span>
I just had to try
    <span>F</span>                 <span>Bb</span>    <span>C</span>...
To keep your life in view

                   <span>Dm</span>
Wish that I could fly
<span>C</span>    <span>F</span>             <span>Bb</span>  <span>C</span>
I’d be beside you now
    <span>Bb</span>            <span>Dm</span>
But I could only sigh
<span>C</span>    <span>F</span>                <span>Bb</span>    <span>C</span>
And watch you circle round


<span>Gm</span>  <span>Am</span>          <span>Dm</span>  <span>Bb</span>   <span>Gm</span>     <span>Am</span> 
         <span>Dm</span> <span>Bb</span>
