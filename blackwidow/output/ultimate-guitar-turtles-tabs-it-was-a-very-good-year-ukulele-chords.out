It Was A Very Good Year chords
The Turtles 1965 (Erwin Drake 1961)

Capo III

<span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span>

           <span>Bm</span>
When I was seventeen
         <span>C</span>
It was a very good year
         <span>Bm</span>                 <span>D</span>
It was a very good year for small town girls
    <span>C</span>
And soft summer nights
     <span>B</span>
We d hide from the lights
       <span>A</span>
On the village green
           <span>B</span>
When I was seventeen

<span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span>

           <span>Bm</span>
When I was twenty-one
         <span>C</span>  
It was a very good year
         <span>Bm</span>                 <span>D</span>
It was a very good year for city girls
    <span>C</span>
Who lived up the stair
     <span>B</span>
With perfumed hair
     <span>A</span>
that came undone
           <span>B</span>
When I was twenty-one

<span>Bm</span> <span>F#</span>

            <span>Bm</span>
But now the days grow short
           <span>C</span>
I'm in the autumn of the year
    <span>Bm</span>                        <span>D</span>
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
     <span>C</span>
from fine old kegs
         <span>B</span>
from the brim to the dregs
     <span>A</span>
It s oh sweet and clear
         <span>B</span>              <span>A</span>
It was a very good year
         <span>B</span>              <span>A</span>
It was a very good year
         <span>B</span>              <span>A</span>
It was a very good year  . . .
