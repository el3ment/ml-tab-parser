You got a thing about you..I just can't live

<span>Em</span>                        <span>A9</span>          <span>Am</span>
Your looks intoxicate me..even though your folks 

hate me.

There's no one like you, Elenore, really.

CHORUS:
<span>E</span>                            <span>Abm</span>
Elenore, gee, I think you're swell and you really 
      <span>A</span>
do me well.
          <span>E</span>                 <span>B7</span>
You're my pride and joy, et cetera.

Elenore, can I take the time, to ask you to speak 
     <span>B7</span>                             <span>E</span>       B-C-B-G ***
your mind..tell me that you love me better?

<span>B7</span>                             <span>Em</span>      <span>C</span> <span>B7</span>
What do you say, now, Elenore, can we?
<span>Em</span>                                    <span>A9</span>
They'll turn the lights way down low..maybe we won't 
<span>Am</span>
watch the show.
<span>B7</span>                           <span>Em</span>       B-C-B-G  
I think I love you, Elenore, love me.
