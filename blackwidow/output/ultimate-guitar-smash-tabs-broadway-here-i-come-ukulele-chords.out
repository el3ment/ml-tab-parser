<span>Eb</span> <span>Bb</span> <span>Eb</span> <span>Bb</span> <span>Eb</span> <span>Bb</span> <span>Eb</span> <span>Bb</span>

      <span>Eb</span>                    <span>Bb</span>              <span>Eb</span>             <span>Bb</span>
I'm high above the city
      <span>Eb</span>                     <span>Bb</span>             <span>Eb</span>             <span>Bb</span>
I'm standing on the ledge
       <span>Eb</span>                    <span>Bb</span>             <span>Eb</span>             <span>Bb</span>
The view from here is pretty
       <span>Eb</span>                    <span>Bb</span>             <span>Eb</span>             <span>Bb</span>
And I step off the edge 

                    <span>Gm</span>     <span>Eb</span>
And now I'm fallin', baby
                     <span>Bb</span>                     <span>F</span>
Through the sky, through the sky
               <span>Gm</span>    <span>Eb</span>                      <span>Bb</span>   <span>Dm</span>  
And I'm fallin', baby through the sky
           <span>Eb</span>       <span>F</span>
It's my callin', baby
                <span>Gm</span>                 <span>C</span>
Don't you cry, don't you cry
              <span>Eb</span>                                  <span>Bb</span>
And I'm fallin' down through the sky

                                         <span>C</span>
Toward the street that I'm from
       <span>Eb</span>                      <span>Bb</span>            <span>Eb</span>        <span>Bb</span>      <span>Eb</span>       <span>Bb</span>
Oh, Broadway, here I come


The pressure it increases
The closer that I get
I could almost go to pieces
But I'm not quite there yet
See, I've been bravin' crazy weather
Drownin' out my cries
I pull myself together
I'm focused on the prize

And now I'm fallin', baby
Through the sky, through the sky
I'm fallin', baby through the sky
It's my callin', baby
Don't you cry, don't you dry
'Cause I'm fallin' down through the sky

And it's a tune you can hum
Oh, Broadway here I come

Continue <span>Bb</span> <span>Eb</span> throughout
Will I remain the same
Or will I change a little bit?
Will I feel broken or totally complete?

<span>C</span>
Will I retain my name when I'm the biggest, hugest hit?
             <span>Dm</span>                                       <span>F</span>               
Or will I blend in with the rest of the street
<span>Dm</span>           <span>F</span>


<span>Eb</span>                         <span>Bb</span>             <span>Eb</span>         <span>Bb</span>     etc etc
The people all are pointing
I bet they'd never guess
That the saint that they're anointing
Is frightened of the mess
But even though I fear it
I'm playin' all my cards...
Baby, you are gonna hear it
When I give them my regards

And I'm fallin' baby
Through the sky, through the sky
Now I'm fallin', baby through the sky
It's my callin', baby
Don't you cry, don't you cry
And I'm fallin' down through the sky


                             <span>C</span>
And I refuse to go numb
      <span>Eb</span>                      <span>Bb</span>    
Oh, Broadway here I come
Broadway, here I come
Broadway, here I come
Oh, Broadway, Broadway, here I come
Here I come!


                               <span>C</span>
And the last thing I hear
                                <span>Bb</span>
As the impact grows near
                             <span>Eb</span>
Is it a scream or a cheer?

Well, never mind, I'll never find out
                                   <span>Bb</span>
'Cause Broadway I am here
