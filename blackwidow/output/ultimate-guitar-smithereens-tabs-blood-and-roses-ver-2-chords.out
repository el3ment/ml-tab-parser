This is a little different from the versions you'll find online. I thought was 
easier if the whole song was chorded out. During the break, I do a single strum 
between the Em and D for 4 counts. Feel free to take liberties with it, it's a 
great tune. Enjoy!

Tuning: Standard

<span>Em</span>      <span>G</span>   <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span> <span>Em</span>         <span>G</span>    <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span>
It was long ago… seems like yesterday
   <span>Em</span>        <span>G</span>     <span>Em</span>        <span>G</span> <span>D</span> <span>Em</span>      <span>G</span>        <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span>
I saw you standing in the rain… then I heard you say
   <span>C</span>                    <span>D</span>         <span>Em</span>
I want to love but it comes out wrong
   <span>C</span>                   <span>D</span>      <span>Em</span>
I want to live but I don’t belong
    <span>C</span>                  <span>D</span>              <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span> <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span>
I close my eyes and I see blood and roses
          <span>Em</span>    <span>G</span>        <span>Em</span>     <span>G</span> <span>D</span>   <span>Em</span>      <span>G</span>        <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span>
Brought flowers in the springtime… I told her we were wed
     <span>Em</span>    <span>G</span>        <span>Em</span>    <span>G</span>  <span>D</span>     <span>Em</span>        <span>G</span>        <span>Em</span>        <span>G</span> <span>D</span>
In wintertime the roses died… her blood ran cold and then she said
   <span>C</span>                    <span>D</span>         <span>Em</span>
I want to love but it comes out wrong
   <span>C</span>                   <span>D</span>      <span>Em</span>
I want to live but I don’t belong
    <span>C</span>                  <span>D</span>              <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span> <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span> <span>Em</span>…
I close my eyes and I see blood and roses

Break:

<span>Em</span>       <span>G</span>  <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span> <span>Em</span>        <span>G</span>    <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span>
It was long ago… seems like yesterday
   <span>Em</span>        <span>G</span>     <span>Em</span>       <span>G</span> <span>D</span>  <span>Em</span>      <span>G</span>        <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span>
I saw you standing in the rain… then I heard you say
    <span>C</span>                   <span>D</span>         <span>Em</span>
I need to love but it comes out wrong
    <span>C</span>                   <span>D</span>      <span>Em</span>
I tried to live but I don’t belong
    <span>C</span>                  <span>D</span>              <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>Em</span> <span>G</span>
I close my eyes and I see blood and roses
  <span>D</span>         <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>Em</span> <span>G</span>
Blood and roses
  <span>D</span>         <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>Em</span> <span>G</span>
Blood and roses
  <span>D</span>         <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>Em</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span> <span>Em</span>…
Blood and roses
