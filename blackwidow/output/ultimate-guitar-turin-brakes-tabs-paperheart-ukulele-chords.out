Verse:
<span>B</span>           <span>A</span>
This is not me
<span>B</span>                            <span>A</span>
I was never cut out for this scenery
<span>B</span>               <span>A</span>
Im just a paper boy
<span>B</span>                   <span>A</span>
Youre crushed paper toy

Nothing has changed
Only paper landscapes ripped and rearrganged
By an angry girl
This torn paper world

Chorus:
<span>C</span>                        <span>B</span>  
If only I knew that your smile 
<span>C</span>                          <span>B</span>   <span>A</span>
would set fire to my paper heart
<span>B</span>    <span>A</span>
Paperheart

I live by the sea 
Not the one youre thinkign 
The sea inside of me
Its just a paper dream
To you unseen

But you shake the ground
You rearrgande the sunset and terrorise the town
And its you i blame when i crash paper plane

Chorus:
If only i knew that your smile
Would set fire to my paper heart

If only I knew from the start
Youd tear right through my paper heart
Paper heart
