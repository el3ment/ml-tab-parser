Happy Together
Gary Bonner and Alan Gordon

              <span>Em</span>             
Imagine me and you, I do.
                             <span>D</span>
I think about you day and night, it’s only right.
                              <span>C</span>
To think about the girl you love, and hold her tight.
                   <span>B</span>
So happy together.


                  <span>Em</span>
If I should call you up, invest a dime.
                                <span>D</span>
And you say you belong to me, and ease my mind.
                            <span>C</span>               
Imagine how the world would be, so very fine.
                   <span>B</span>
So happy together.


<span>E</span>                   <span>Bm7</span>                      <span>E</span>               <span>G</span>
I can see me lovin’ nobody but you, for all my life.
<span>E</span>                                  <span>Bm7</span>                            <span>E</span>     <span>G</span>
When you’re with me baby, the skies will be blue for all my life.
<span>Em</span>                        
Me and you, and you and me.
                               <span>D</span>             
No matter how the toss the dice, it was to be.
                            <span>C</span>            
The only one for me is you, and you for me.
                    <span>B</span>
So happy together.


               <span>Em</span>             
Imagine me and you, I do.
                             <span>D</span>
I think about you day and night, it’s only right.
                              <span>C</span>
To think about the girl you love, and hold her tight.
                   <span>B</span>
So happy together.

I can see me lovin’ nobody but you, for all my life.
<span>E</span>                                  <span>Bm7</span>                            <span>E</span>          <span>G</span>
When you’re with me baby, the skies will be blue for all my life.
<span>Em</span>                        
Me and you, and you and me.
                               <span>D</span>             
No matter how the toss the dice, it was to be.

So happy together.


<span>E</span>                            <span>B</span>
So happy together.
<span>E</span>                           <span>B</span>
How is the weather?
<span>E</span>                           <span>B</span>
So happy together. (Repeat and fade)
