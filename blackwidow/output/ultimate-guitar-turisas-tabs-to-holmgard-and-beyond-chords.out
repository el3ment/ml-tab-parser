Far from the sea and distant lands
     <span>Dm</span>  <span>Am</span>          <span>Dm</span>    <span>Am</span>/ <span>C</span>
Came men with thirty ships
    <span>Dm</span>        <span>Am</span>        <span>Dm</span>      <span>C</span>
Had wanted to reach the Neva by night
        <span>F</span>                        <span>C</span>
But the weather was not on their side

           <span>Gm</span>                     <span>Dm</span>
And as the wind grew stronger and stronger
    <span>Gm</span>                <span>Dm</span>
The rain ran down our cheeks
    <span>F</span>                      <span>C</span>
The bow was turned towards Gardar
    <span>A</span>
The sail flew up again

<span>Dm</span>                  <span>Bb</span> <span>G7</span> <span>C</span>      
Holmgard and beyond
<span>Dm</span>               <span>F</span>             <span>C</span>
That's where the winds will us guide
<span>Dm</span>                    <span>Bb</span> <span>G7</span> <span>C</span>
For fame and for gold
<span>Dm</span>                 <span>F</span>     <span>A</span>
Set sail for those lands unknown

<span>Dm</span>          <span>Am</span>      <span>Dm</span>        <span>Am/C</span>
Osmo and Dalk, Kyy, Kokko and Ulf
     <span>Dm</span>      <span>Am</span>         <span>Dm</span>    <span>Am/C</span>
Were glad to be off the oars
<span>Dm</span>       <span>Am</span>        <span>Dm</span>    <span>C</span>
Turo had eaten too much again
    <span>F</span>                   <span>C</span>
Now hanging himself overboard

               <span>Gm</span>                    <span>Dm</span>
The Tostensson twins were excited as always
  <span>Gm</span>                <span>Dm</span>
Adventure was their game
  <span>F</span>               <span>C</span>
Myself, Hakon the Bastard
    <span>A</span>
was out to find my name

<span>Dm</span>                  <span>Bb</span> <span>G7</span> <span>C</span>      
Holmgard and beyond
<span>Dm</span>               <span>F</span>             <span>C</span>
That's where the winds will us guide
<span>Dm</span>                    <span>Bb</span> <span>G7</span> <span>C</span>
For fame and for gold

Set sail for those lands unknown

Dm ...... (throughout spoken word part; feel free to skip)

Who is "I" without a past?
A river without a source?
An event without a cause?

Threads of different lengths
Some longer, some shorter
So many of them spun together 

The crones keep on weaving
The algorithm of our lives
Cause and effect, the fates of men

<span>D5</span> <span>E5</span>-<span>F5</span> <span>E5</span> <span>D5</span>-<span>C5</span> <span>A5</span>

<span>Dm</span>
We know the way to Aldeigju
  <span>Dm</span>
Upstream the river Alode
<span>F</span>   <span>G</span>              <span>Dm</span>
You take us to the portage
       <span>Am</span>
And further (South)

<span>Dm</span>
Long is the way to the unknown
<span>Dm</span>           <span>Em</span>            <span>F</span>    
Long are the rivers in the East
<span>F</span>            <span>G</span>         <span>Dm</span>
Far lies the land that Ingvar
        <span>Dm7</span>   <span>B5</span> <span>A5</span> <span>G5</span> <span>A</span>
And his men desi-re to reach

<span>Bb</span>    <span>C</span>            <span>F</span>
 Many dangers lie ahead
<span>Bb</span>             <span>F</span>       <span>C</span>
Some of us may never return
<span>Bb</span>     <span>C</span>         <span>F</span>            <span>G</span>
Rather sold as a slave to the Saracens
     <span>Asus4</span>           <span>A</span>    <span>Asus4</span>           <span>A</span>
Than chained to your bed, chained by your life!


<span>Dm</span>                  <span>Bb</span> <span>G7</span> <span>C</span>      
Holmgard and beyond
<span>Dm</span>               <span>F</span>             <span>C</span>
That's where the winds will us guide
<span>Dm</span>                    <span>Bb</span> <span>G7</span> <span>C</span>
For fame and for gold
<span>Dm</span>                 <span>F</span>     <span>A</span>
Set sail for those lands unknown

<span>Dm</span>    | (<span>Dm</span>) <span>Bb</span> <span>G7</span> <span>C</span> | <span>Dm</span>    | <span>F</span> <span>C</span>     |
<span>Dm</span>    | (<span>Dm</span>) <span>Bb</span> <span>G7</span> <span>C</span> | <span>Dm</span>    | <span>F</span> <span>A</span> <span>G</span> <span>A</span> |
